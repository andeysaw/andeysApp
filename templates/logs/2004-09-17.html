<p>I woke up in my bed for the first time in a long while and ate whatever I had in the refrigerator. I called my sister and arranged to meet them in San Francisco, eventually deciding on going to City Hall. I took the BART train there and, knowing I had some time left, went inside the building for the first time to look at its stately interior. Outside, my sister and her family picked me on Van Ness Avenue and we headed north.</p>

<p>My sister most wanted to see Marin County, so we drove over the Golden Gate Bridge and stopped at the Golden Gate Vista Point for photographs. Then, we drove through Sausalito to look at the town, but did not stop there. I pointed out an In and Out Burger in Mill Valley and we ended up eating lunch there. We then went to Tiburon where my sister shopped a little and visited the office of the Tiburon Film Festival out of curiousity.</p>

<p>For our final stop in the county, we went to San Rafael, where my sister found out about the Northgate Mall. After she finished shopping there, we headed across the Richmond Bridge, got gas at Costco, then crossed the Bay Bridge back to San Francisco. My sister shopped at the San Francisco Shopping Centre, where the kids enjoyed the view up of the circular escalators. Then, we spent a long time at Macy's in Union Square because of a sale there. I went back to Berkeley after that.</p>
