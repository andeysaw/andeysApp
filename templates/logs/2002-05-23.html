<p>Morning was chilly. Despite that we managed to get an early start. After packing up and checking out from the Pecos River Campground, we made the short drive to Pecos National Historical Park. We parked and picked up a loaner guidebook before heading out on the trail.</p>

<p>The first ruin we noticed was the impressive one of the old mission church, uphill in the distance. First, though, we came upon the remains of the village's rock walls. A small rattlesnake slithered off the path towards them. At a trail intersection, we found a reconstructed kiva, which we climbed into to take a look around inside.</p>

<p>The ruins of Pecos Pueblo itself, abandoned in the early nineteenth century, were not all that great, so we headed to the mission church for a close look at that. Unfortunately, we found that access was limited because there was some sort of construction work going on at the site. Joy asked one worker to duck so that she could take a picture of the ruins. Despite the trail restrictions, we enjoyed the hike overall.</p>

<p>We went back on the road and drove past Santa Fe, finally arriving in Albuquerque and then the visitor center for Petroglyph National Monument. From the information we got there, we decided to hike Rinconada Canyon, which we were told had about 800 petroglyphs. However, we didn't find nearly that many, but perhaps didn't look closely enough. After that, we headed across town to the Sandia Peak Tramway, stopping at a supermarket on the way for more trip supplies.</p>

<p>Apparently we got to the ticket desk not too long after a tram left, so after buying our own round-trip tickets, we had a brief wait. We would have browsed the gift shop, but it was closed because new carpet was just installed. Being early did get us choice spots and when we boarded, we decided to face the view of the city. The announcer talked mainly about the features of the mountain and its canyons. A particularly interesting fact he pointed out was that we could still spot the shiny metal remains of TWA flight 260 that crashed into the mountain in 1955.</p>

<p>We reached the top at 10,378 feet with a wonderful view of Albuquerque below. Clearly, we could see the green ribbon of vegetation where the Rio Grande flowed through the city. On the tram, we had noticed Kiwanis Cabin on a high overlook. The announcer had pointed it out and said that it was built to shelter hikers from bad weather. We decided to take the hike there, because it made for a good goal while we were on the mountain.</p>

<p>We had a pleasant walk through forests and past a meadow, but a chill wind blew on us as we reached the old cabin. It had a roof but open windows. Despite that, we rested there, enjoying the great view of the city and reading some of the graffiti on the walls. We returned to the station in good time for the trip back down on the tram. One bit of excitement down was that we spotted a man on top of the tram car passing us on the way up, but I guessed it was an employee, judging from the lack of reaction from the announcer.</p>

<p>I wondered if we had time to visit Acoma that day, but was convinced otherwise when I saw the traffic leaving the city west on I-40. Instead, we stopped quickly to see what Old Town looked like, then started heading north to Bernalillo to camp. On our way, we saw an REI store, so we took a little time there to get Joy a hat with a strap so it would not blow away in the wind, which the other one she bought earlier did. I used a discount coupon I had brought with me. We also tried to get Nalgene Lexan bottles, but found out they had run out of them.</p>

<p>When we first entered the Coronado Campground in Bernalillo, it didn't look like it had any good tent sites. Then the camp host registered us and pointed the way to the tent area. It was close to a good view of the Rio Grande River. Next to our site was a big group of geology students from Alabama, so we decided to take showers right away, while they were readily available. We then cooked and ate a simple dinner.</p>

<p>With some time to spare we thought we might check out the interesting looking Sandia Casino we saw earlier, but then I noticed that the Santa Ana Star Casino was right next door. We went over there to take a look around inside. Upstairs was a bowling alley and an arcade where Joy played the classic game of Ms. PacMan. I watched her play as well as looked at the other, more modern games. We left soon after that to sleep at the campground.</p>
