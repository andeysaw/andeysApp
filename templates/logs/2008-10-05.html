<p>Rain fell all night, making my tent quite damp inside. I did not want to leave the tent in the wet weather, but then had to for the restroom at 3 AM after some apprehension. I awoke at 4:50 AM and quickly got my wet tent into the shelter of the restroom to pack it up. When done, I got into the truck and we drove out, making a stop at one gas station before hitting the highway. The rain became scattered showers as we made our way southeast to Roswell.</p>

<p>We stopped for a brief break near Clines Corners and later near Mesa. Mostly, we saw a vast plain on our drive with some unremarkable hills. I saw a sign pointing to Billy the Kid's grave, but we didn't go out of our way to see it. When we entered Roswell, we noted any alien themes such as signs on the front of the Wal-Mart Supercenter and Arby's. We then found the International UFO Museum and Research Library, parked and entered.</p>

<p>Art with alien themes could be found all over the museum lobby as well as in the small library. One piece of wall had signatures and comments of notable visitors. After admission, the museum displays started with the historic accounts of the Roswell crash of 1947. The rest of the museum explained various phenomena associated with encounters with sentient extraterrestrials such as crop circles, abduction stories and types of sightings.</p>

<p>Pui and Craig picked up plenty of alien themed stuff from the museum gift shop and then we went to a store called Starchild across the street to look at more tacky souvenirs. We then walked up Main Street to the Alien Zone and Cosmic Jukebox shop to see the silly alien decorations there. For a small fee, we got into a section called Area 51 that had aliens in various scenarios set up for cheesy photo opportunities. The area furthest back had a model of a glowing futuristic city.</p>

<p>For lunch, we ate at the McDonalds on Main Street only because it had a play area in the shape of a saucer and a mural on the side of Ronald McDonald in space. I ordered an Angus beef burger but found the service really slow. Fortunately, we had no need to hurry. We headed to the Roswell Museum and Art Center after that, glad we could be indoors as a light rain fell. Our group separated as we wandered the museum rooms.</p>

<p>I glanced at paintings by Howard Cook and Barbara Latham and then checked out art by locals done during the Great Depression as part of the Federal Art Project. The building had a large area dedicated to local Robert H. Goddard, known for his work on liquid-propelled rocketry. One exhibit contained the Apollo 17 suit of moon walker and New Mexico native Jack Schmitt, who praised Goddard in an audio recording.</p>

<p>I passed through exhibits chronicling different aspects of local history and then looked around the small modern art gallery as well as courtyard sculptures. I saw simple geometric paintings by Susan Dopp and the abstract expressionist paintings of Native Americans by Fritz Scholder. I liked the landscapes by Peter Hurd and Henriette Wyeth in the Founders Gallery. The rain had stopped by then, so I ventured outside to see sculptures on the grounds.</p>

<p>With still more daylight remaining, we headed southeast of town to Bottomless Lakes State Park. A light rain had us ducking into the tiny visitor center for a brief tour by an employee of the exhibits about the park and its sinkhole lakes. With outdoors dry again, we then looked at beautiful Cottonwood Lake with its steep cliffs on most sides. We also enjoyed Mirror Lake and Devil's Inkwell but found Figure Eight Lake and Pasture Lake disappointing.</p>

<p>At Lea Lake, we found an historic complex of buildings including a water tower made of stone. The lake had a swimming area but we just took photos by the shore. We soon continued driving, stopping to observe a coyote in the brush before arriving at a great view overlooking Lea Lake and beyond. After that, we returned to Roswell for fuel and continued south through Carlsbad, where we had to slosh through flooded streets.</p>

<p>We reached White's City after sunset, registering for our campsite at the hotel with young, bored staff. We set up camp and enjoyed our quiet, grassy location, eating dinner at a picnic table with uneven seats. I felt disgusted, though, upon entering the bathroom. It had a layer of dead moths on the counter and some elsewhere as well. I decided not to shower there but could deal with the mess otherwise. I managed to get ready for sleep and then slept.</p>
