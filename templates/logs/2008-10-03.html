<p>We got up at 5 AM, packed up and left camp by 6:30 AM. On our scenic drive north, I had planned for us to stop at Oak Creek Canyon Vista, but found the road to it gated. In Flagstaff, we turned east and continued until we reached Meteor Crater, arriving 20 minutes too early, so just waited by the gate, taking a few pictures and noticing a welcome announcement already blaring from the visitor center lot. We got in first after the gate opened.</p>

<p>After admission, we saw an Apollo test capsule and astronaut wall of fame and then headed for the small museum with exhibits about meteors and the effects of their impact. We stopped to watch a film in the theater about the meteor crater's history and then finished the museum. With a bit more time until the rim tour, we checked out the middle of three viewpoints overlooking the crater. Fixed scopes pointed out areas of interest.</p>

<p>Our tour, guided by a friendly, funny guy named Eduardo, started inside next to a remnant of the meteorite that formed the crater. Our guide then led us outside along the rim, stopping at view points to talk history and geology. We had an overcast sky with haze from a controlled fire near Flagstaff. By rock samples, Eduardo offered water in small paper cones and then showed us the ruins of the old visitor center. We took photos at a jut out point before returning.</p>

<p>To complete the visit, I looked at the crater area from a high lookout and then the lowest one. We all then spent time in the gift shop and ate lunch at a Subway Sandwich franchise next to it. I got a six inch melt. When all done, we continued east on I-40. The Meteor City Trading Post caught Pui's eye, so we stopped to take photos of a huge dream catcher and other the kitschy stuff and then entered the shop to browse. The shop keeper had an adorable limping Chihuahua as a pet.</p>

<p>I drove the segment that took us to the southern end of Petrified Forest National Park, missing a turn. I remembered, though, that I could use the mounted GPS unit to find my way back. Upon park entry, we visited the small Rainbow Forest Museum and walked the Giant Logs trail behind it, enjoying the texture and multiple colors of the petrified wood scattered about. After doing a loop, we returned to the truck and resumed driving north.</p>

<p>Soon, we entered the Painted Desert, first stopping briefly at formations known as The Teepees. Horizontal bands of colors ran through the eroded hills. Next, we visited a viewpoint overlooking Newspaper Rock, noting its dense collection of petroglyphs. Another stop had the remains of Puerco Pueblo's foundation and plenty more petroglyphs. On our drive north, we stopped at the sight of the shell of an old car and found an exhibit dedicated to Route 66.</p>

<p>We soon reached an impressive area of badlands and stopped at Pintado Point to admire them. Then, we visited the former Painted Desert Inn to look at its adobe construction and interior wall art with southwestern themes. Behind it stood Kachina Point, where we got a grand view that improved as the sun descended. After that, we left the park and made a final stop in Arizona at Indian City, where Pui got a deal on a blanket and we had ice cream.</p>

<p>In Gallup, New Mexico, we fueled up and then reached the well-lighted city of Albuquerque, where we turned north to the campground at Coronado State Monument. The host said no more shelters were available, so we just found a flat spot below the parking area to camp. I spilled soup trying to cook on the ground so wasted one can. I ate another and then used the shower, free to campers. We went to sleep after that.</p>
