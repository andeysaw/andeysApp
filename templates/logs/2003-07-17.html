<p>We got up and got the car out of the garage before we had to pay more than the overnight fee for parking there. We drove to the Museum Campus and parked near the Adler Planetarium. While waiting for the John G. Shedd Aquarium to open, we ate leftover pizza for breakfast and just relaxed. Near opening time, we waited by the doors and got in quick as CityPass holders, while others had to wait in a growing line.</p>

<p>We went directly to the newest and most popular exhibit, called Wild Reef, getting their first. But many people soon followed and it quickly became quite crowded. Regardless, we still had room to look around at the colorful coral reefs with its interesting inhabitants. The exhibit gave information about all the creatures and also about reef destruction and protection, highlighting a successful restoration and management program on Apo Island in the Philippines.</p>

<p>Next, we visited the Oceanarium and sat down just in time to watch a dolphin show. The trainers brought out dolphins to do tricks such as spyhopping, jumping and backswimming. They also noted two of the four dolphins were pregant and wanted the audience to guess who by watching their energy level compared to others. The dolpins ended the show with an impressive coordinated jump into the air.</p>

<p>The crowd got up and we followed some of them into the Seahorse Symphony exhibit, where we saw different varieties of seahorses and their relatives such as pipefishes and seadragons. Then, we went to the rest of the Oceanarium to look at the beluga whales, sea otters, harbor seals and penguins, reading information displays along the way. We saw the beluga whale and dolpin tanks from above and below the water.</p>

<p>We exited the Oceanarium and began looking around the classic aquarium, starting with seeing fish from Illinois then moving onto fish from ocean coasts, tropical waters, Africa and Australasia. In the middle of it all, we saw a cylindrical tank containing a Caribbean reef. We visited the Amazon Rising exhibit last. It chronicled the life of people and other creatures in the Amazon jungle and how they have adapted to long lasting, seasonal flooding.</p>

<p>We walked over to The Field Museum next and entered using CityPass. After checking out Sue, the largest, most complete Tyrannosaurus Rex ever found, we went downstairs to the Underground Adventure, because the exhibit was included in our CityPass admission. The exhibit aimed mainly at youth, judging from its style of presentation. We continued anyway, getting &ldquo;shrunk&rdquo; as we entered a representation of the world just under the soil, filled with plant roots and bugs. After emerging from the passage, we &ldquo;returned to normal size&rdquo; and read displays about soil.</p>

<p>We saw a few small displays in the corridors, including the preserved body of a lowland gorilla popular in Chicago and a man-eating lion from East Africa. Then, we entered the Inside Ancient Egypt exhibit, which had a mostly replicated tomb with a couple rooms containing authentic ancient walls and hieroglyphs, protected by barriers. We saw mummies inside as well as other funerary artifacts. The room after the tomb had more artifacts, arranged to show how the ancients may have used them in a Memphis marketplace.</p>

<p>We took a quick look through the exhibit showing models of plants of the world, then moved on to the Hall of Gems to admire the pretty rocks. An exhibit called Traveling the Pacific tried to give us an idea of the reality of life on a tropical island. It housed an extensive display of artifacts from different islands, but we didn't get a good look at them all because we had to leave as the museum closed.</p>

<p>As we got to the car and left, I could see lightning in the distance. We planned to have dinner at the house of my brother's friend Chris in the suburb of Homewood. As we got into town, a heavy rain began falling along with heavy winds. The street began flooding and getting cluttered by branches, but we made it to the house without problems.</p>

<p>Inside, my brother went upstairs to hang out with Chris, while I had a conversation with his mother. Then, Chris' dad came home and we all had a delicious dinner of ribs. They asked if we wanted to stay the night, but we decided to continue on to our reserved campsite. Back outside in the thunderstorm, we drove west then south until we reached Starved Rock State Park, where lightning still flashed, but little rain fell.</p>

<p>We got to the park after the attendant had already closed the office, but we already knew which campsite we had. However, when we got there, a couple had already set up camp there. They said the attendant gave them the campsite, but said they were willing to share it with us. I felt suspicious about them, but decided to just take another one of the many empty, reserved campsites after finding all the unreservable ones full. We set up camp, showered, then slept.</p>
