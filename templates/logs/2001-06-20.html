<p>I had done most of my packing for my trip on previous days, so had some time to relax after I woke up. Hoping I did not forget anything important, I then made my way to the airport. I took the Bay Area Rapid Transit train from Berkeley to Colma, then took the express Samtrans bus to the new international terminal at San Francisco International Airport. After checking in, I found out I had plenty of time until my flight, so relaxed and chatted with one of the airport employees.</p>

<p>When I boarded the Japan Airlines airplane, I was pleased to find that each seat had an individual screen with a control pad to choose what to view or play. The only thing I didn't quite like was the position of the seat. It was near a window, as requested, but the exit door jutted out, limiting my leg room.</p>
