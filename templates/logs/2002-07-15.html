<p>My brother and I had only minimal packing to do in the morning. We ate the complimentary breakfast in the hotel restaurant then checked out and took a taxi to the airport. We checked in with Japan Airlines with no problems and got on our flight, which left on time. I saw the movies <em>Big Fat Liar</em> and <em>Clockstoppers</em> during the flight.</p>

<p>We arrived in Japan in the late afternoon and bought unreserved tickets for the Haruka Airport Express train. After boarding, we relaxed and watched the scenery go by. Even though Japan has a reputation for being safe, I did keep an eye on my luggage as a habit. The train conductor entered to check everybody's tickets from the front to back, then went back to the front again to bow before leaving in the back.</p>

<p>Night fell by the time we reached Kyoto Station, an impressive, expansive modern building. We walked outside to a view of Kyoto Tower, then continued through the streets to a quiet small street by the Takase Canal where we found our traditional Japanese Inn, Yuhara Ryokan. A courteous middle aged Japanese man greeted us and we showed papers with our reservation information. We took off our shoes, putting them on a shelf, then put on the ryokan shoes to go to our room.</p>

<p>Our room had the name &ldquo;Ume.&rdquo; Like a traditional room, it had tatami mats, floor level beds, a simply decorated corner, a low table and yukatas for each of us to wear around the place. However, it did have modern walls, a sink, air conditioning and a television that cost 100 Yen an hour to use. Our host showed us the location of the toilets, phone and bath room, then we went back to our room for green tea and crackers.</p>

<p>When the host had prepared our bath, he called and I went first, wearing my yukata. I sat down on a small stool, took a shower and rinsed off before soaking in the deep bath, which had a temperature comfortable enough for me to stay for a few minutes. I got out, dried myself off, put on the yukata and returned to my room. After my brother got his turn, we went to sleep.</p>
