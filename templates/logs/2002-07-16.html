<p>After waking up, getting ready for the day and leaving the ryokan, we checked out a nearby coffee shop for breakfast. We did not like the menu options, so we headed towards the Southern Higashiyama area. We ended up just getting a drink from a vending machine before making it up to Kiyomizu Temple.</p>

<p>The temple had a main hall with a huge veranda and a good view of the urban center of Kyoto. We walked around the grounds then came upon the Otowa-no-taki waterfall, split into three narrow drops. Some believe the sacred waters have therapeutic properties. For fun, we drank a little of the water, using the provided small cups with long handles. The storage niche had sterilized the cups with ultravoilet light, according to the label by it.</p>

<p>We continued north from the temple, observing the traditional Japanese shops opening for the day. At one point we heard a lively, quick exchange of &ldquo;ohayo gozaimasu&rdquo; (good morning) between neighboring shopkeepers as they opened. We kept walking until we reached the entrance to Kodai Temple, which we just saw from the outside. Water flowed down both sides of the path leading up to it.</p>

<p>Continuing on, we saw big group of only Japanese women, some in yukatas, seated under a canopy. They looked like they were waiting for entry into some place, perhaps a restaurant. We also occasionally passed men with two person carts, offering to pull people along. We then entered the Yasaka Shrine, where we saw some people setting up for a festival to be held later that day.</p>

<p>From there, we went east to Maruyama Park, with its scenic ponds, and started to really get hungry after not eating breakfast or a real dinner the night before. At the north end of the park, we entered a restaurant called Imobo Hiranoya Honten and got seating in a private tatami room. We both had the set lunch of delicious imobo, a dried fish served with sweet potato.</p>

<p>Going north, we walked through Chion Temple, inside a pedestrian tunnel, past groups of uniformed students, then west to Nanzen temple. We looked at its big buildings, an acqueduct, a graveyard and then went up the hillside to the small, slim waterfall by the small Kotoku Shrine. A muddy path made us decide not to go further and we turned back to Nanzen Temple, then went north.</p>

<p>We soon reached the Tetsugaku-no-Michi (Path of Philosophy), a long, quiet path next to a canal. Along the way, we stopped for a drink at one of the many vending machines around. I went for one with an interesting label, saying it was &ldquo;Carbo-Flexible!&rdquo; A detour off the path led us to Honen Temple, where we saw an indoor exhibit of rock sculptures.</p>

<p>Finally at the end of our path walk, we headed for Ginkaku Temple. After an approach between high hedges, we entered and quickly came upon its main attraction, the Silver Pavillion. In front of the two story wooden building lay a raked white sand garden and a white sand conical mound being worked on by a couple guys. We enjoyed the scene, then took the steps up a hillside for a greater view of the grounds before heading out.</p>

<p>We walked west from the temple to a bus stop, then got on a bus to the subway station at Imadegawa. From there, we took the subway to Nijo Castle. We got free souvenir fans as we entered, which turned out to be useful inside the stuffy Ninomaru Palace. In the palace, we got a glimpse of shogun life in the seventeenth century, walking by big rooms with no furniture and painted walls. Our feet all caused chirping noises as we walked on the &ldquo;nightingale&rdquo; floors designed to expose intruders.</p>

<p>It began to rain as we exited the palace and checked out the gardens. It continued off and on as we explored the grounds. We crossed the inner moat to see the outside of Honmaru Palace, then checked out the view from the donjon before crossing the other side of the inner moat. At the garden of Seiryu-en, we watched and listened to traditionally clothed women in the Koun-tei building play traditional Japanese music. We stopped last at a gift shop before leaving.</p>

<p>The night before, I read about a &ldquo;Swan Dance&rdquo; performance this day in the evening at Yasaka Shrine as part of the Yoiyama Festival (and bigger Gion Festival), so we took the subway there. We saw food stands and a carnival game where you shoot at cigarette cartons. With no more seating available for us, we stood and waited for the performance to begin. Finally, out came an announcer, then a presentation of gifts to men in white and teal clothes with cylinderical black hats. All this happened in Japanese that I could not understand.</p>

<p>We grew quite hungry and tired, but stayed to watch a green guy dance with a fan and bells. Then came a performance of a masked guy with a white fluffy object, representing a swan, I presume, and a guy with a sword. They danced around each other, freezing in poses at times while a story teller said something in Japanese. Finally, the two guys exchanged the swan and sword. We saw the beginning of a fight sequence between two new costumed guys just before we left.</p>

<p>We walked out of the shrine and ran into a massive crowd on Schijo-dori. Both sides of the street lit up with hanging lanterns. We went through there, then turned north to the restaurant Senmonten to eat fried gyozo (Chinese dumplings).</p>

<p>After the meal, we continued walking until we got to the Sanjo Covered Arcade, full of small shops. We turned left from there to the Shinkyogoku Covered Arcade, where we got ice cream to help quell further hunger. At another shop, my brother bought a wooden sword he wanted. From there, we walked all the way to the end of the arcade back to Schijo-dori, then walked a long way along the Takase Canal to our ryokan to take a bath and sleep.</p>
