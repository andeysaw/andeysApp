<p>My dad started with the driving as we left home in the late morning. First, he had some charts to drop off at Marshall Browning Hospital in Du Quoin. Then, I took over for the drive on the interstate highway. We passed Cairo and made our way through southeast Missouri until we reached Arkansas. There, we stopped in Blytheville to eat at Taco Bell before continuing on to Tennessee.</p>

<p>Just east of Memphis, we reached the home of my parents' friend in Cordova. The caretaker of the house, Tippy, greeted us and we put most of our luggage inside. My parents decided to go shopping with her in her minivan, so Steven and I took our minivan and left for downtown Memphis. Once we found reasonably priced parking, we left the car and took the monorail to Mud Island River Park.</p>

<p>We skipped the Mississippi River Museum for lack of time and interest and headed right for the scale model of the Lower Mississippi River, known as the River Walk. The walk began with water falling over maps of the Upper Mississippi River and other major sources such as the Ohio River. From there, we followed the course of the model, reading panels describing points of interest along the river, historic and geographic.</p>

<p>I found out that many steamboat accidents happened on the river and noted the model's detailing of the effect of the former courses of the river on the landscape. At the end, we arrived at a small body of water representing the Gulf of Mexico. As we walked back to the monorail by the view of the real Mississippi River, I got a call to meet my parents at Rendezvous BBQ. It took us a bit of time to leave the park, find street parking downtown then find the restaurant.</p>

<p>In an alley, we entered the restaurant and found my parents and Tippy, all done with dinner. They ordered dry rub ribs for me and Steven and we ate them. The ribs tasted pretty good, but I still liked juicy ones better. With dinner finished, we walked over to Peabody Place and looked a little bit around the shops. On the way out, my parents took an interest in looking at a Tower Records store and we ended up spending time there.</p>

<p>Just out the store doors, we walked onto Beale Street and immediately heard more than one live band playing, each in different establishments. We stayed outside, though, looking into places as we walked to the end of the pedestrian only area. Then, after going to the opposite side, we found a live blues band called Big Jerry that we stopped to hear. My dad bought their CD. After that, we found another band just off the street and heard their brand of blues.</p>

<p>My parents then decided to go into the Rum Boogie Cafe. Because my brother was not of legal drinking age, I decided to part with them and have dessert with him at Maggie Moos in Peabody Place. Then, we drove the car back to the house in Cordova. Coincidentally, my parents with Tippy came back at the same time. We all went inside and Steven and I slept while the rest stayed up at least a little longer.</p>
