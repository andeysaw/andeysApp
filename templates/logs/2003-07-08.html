<p>Used to getting up early every day of the trip, we ended up having plenty of time left after breaking camp for our first destination of the day. So, we started out with a look around the town of Moose Jaw, especially noting the large, colourful murals and the historic downtown buildings, particularly City Hall. When the Canadian Automobile Association office opened, we then went there so I could get information about customs stations on the international border. In a guide book on a rack, I found the information I sought, the hours of the station I planned to pass through.</p>

<p>We had reserved well in advanced two tours with Moose Jaw Tunnels. As we parked in front of their office, someone on the street told me that cars with out-of-province plates could park for free at the meters. I confirmed it inside when I picked up our tour tickets. After getting the tickets, we just had to wait in the building for our tour to start. In the meantime, we looked at historic photographs on the wall.</p>

<p>A woman soon checked our tickets and led us outside, then into a door below the street for our first tour, called &ldquo;Passage to Fortune.&rdquo; Our guide gave us some information about the nature of the tour. She would get into character as an overseer and pretend she was giving an orientation to new Chinese workers in a clothes laundry business. To start with, we stopped to watch a video about Chinese immigration to Canada. At the end, a woman doctor noted that, although her Chinese grandfather struggled as an immigrant, he ended up giving her the freedom to prosper as a proud Canadian.</p>

<p>The tunnel rooms were set up so we could get some idea of life as an immigrant labourer with a couple rooms having recorded background noise for atmosphere. Of course, we stayed quite safe and comfortable, because they wouldn't have the real chemical smells and loud noise of a real operation. Our guide &ldquo;interacted&rdquo; with the animatronic owner of the laundry as part of the act.</p>

<p>After getting through the rooms, our guide dropped her act and told us a bit more about the history of Chinese immigration into Canada. She especially talked about the head tax and how, despite how steep it became, immigrants still managed to eventually pay it. On a positive note, she ended by talking about the lifting of the head tax and the eventual decline in discrimination. We then went up some stairs which led back into the ticket office.</p>

<p>For our next tour, we had to go across the street and up stairs to wait. A woman dressed in a 1920s flapper dress greeted us a checked our tickets for the &ldquo;Chicago Connection&rdquo; tour. We then entered a mock bar where we sat at the tables watching a video talking about Al Capone's and his crime syndicate and the booze made illegal during America's Prohibition. Our guide pretended she was an entertainer named Miss Fanny, helping us, a group of bootleggers wanting to buy booze from Capone.</p>

<p>A buzzer warned of the approach of &ldquo;Chief Johnson&rdquo; and we got escorted quickly to another room, then to the &ldquo;bedroom&rdquo; of Al Capone. From there, we went into a &ldquo;secret&rdquo; passageway in the closet down some stairs. After getting the secret knock of the day correct, Miss Fanny handed us over to &ldquo;Gus,&rdquo; one of Capone's goons. He talked about the bootlegging operation and led our &ldquo;escape&rdquo; through the tunnels when &ldquo;trouble&rdquo; arose.</p>

<p>It turned out that we got to the other side of the street underground and, when the act finished, we went up the same stairs to the ticket office that we ascended earlier. We quickly left town after this and headed for Regina to make it in time for the Sergeant Major's Parade at the Royal Canadian Mounted Police Academy. It had already started, but we got a good view as the cadets marched around the parade ground. Being cadets still in training, someone would make an occasional mistake.</p>

<p>Soon after the parade, we met up with a guide for a tour of the RCMP Chapel. It had beautiful stained-glass windows of solemn mounties as well as religious figures. Memorial plaques decorated the walls and a book of rememberence in the back displayed names of fallen officers. Outside, a bigger memorial had names of many RCMP officers who fell in the line of duty. The tour continued at the Drill Hall, where we watched cadets marching around indoors.</p>

<p>Having plenty of time until the sunset ceremony, which we also wanted to see, we took our time going through the exhibits of the RCMP Centenniel Museum. It chronicled over a hundreds years of the police service, showing many artifacts and historic documents. When we finished going through, we still had plenty of time, so we set out to explore the city of Regina.</p>

<p>After driving around a little, I decided to take us to Wascana Park to enjoy the lovely day. From there, we got a great view of the domed Saskatchewan Legislative Building. At the park visitor centre, I asked about things to do and ended up checking out a small art gallery on the building's top floor. On one side of the shore of Wascana Lake, we encountered a large gaggle of geese.</p>

<p>When the time came, we returned to the RCMP Academy to watch the Sunset-Retreat Ceremony. A big crowd gathered to see this once a week summertime event. Two police officers on horseback greeted people as well as someone dressed in a costume as &ldquo;Safety Bear.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The event began with an announcer talking and introducing special guests. Then a drum and bagpipe band marched. The cadets then tried, and failed both times, to fire a cannon. The troops did a drill with rifles then the flag got ceremoniously lowered. The even ended with the band marching away.</p>

<p>Finally done for the day, we left Regina and headed southeast to Weyburn to camp at River Park. The attendant there decided that, with our tent, we could just camp on the lawn in front of the office, so we did, and only paid five dollars for it. With the grass wet and no table available, we ate a cold dinner in the car, then took showers and slept.</p>
