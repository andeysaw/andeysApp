<p>My flight to London Gatwick was not until the evening, so I had time to do last minute preparations for my trip. After making sure I was ready, I walked to the Bay Area Rapid Transit station in Berkeley to take the train to Colma. From there, I took a SamTrans express bus to the San Francisco International Airport.</p>

<p>I had booked a flight with Virgin Atlantic Airways because I had heard it had good service. It lived up to its reputation. Each passenger got a free amenity kit in a handy bag, with socks, a notepad, pen, eye mask, ear plugs, tooth brush and paste, and more. It was colorful and stylish with funny labels like &ldquo;forty winks&rdquo; on the eye mask and &ldquo;scrub up&rdquo; on the sealed bag with the tooth brush and paste.</p>

<p>I really enjoyed the entertainment options offered by the display screen directly in front of me after they showed the Sky News broadcast. At my side was the controller where I could choose from several movies, TV shows, music selections, and Nintendo games. I could also watch the flight progress on a map, with little animated icons of Elvis and a pirate ship showing up occasionally.</p>

<p>I checked out all the options and listened to the music and disc jockies long enough to hear it repeat. After eating, I eventually managed to sleep with the help of pillows, the eye mask, and ear plugs.</p>
