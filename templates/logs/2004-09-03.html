<p>We got up fairly early and left the house in Cordova, soon heading south into Mississippi. Getting my wish for no fast food, we found a Waffle House in Senatobia for breakfast, where sat down for some pretty good waffles. Then, we set in for the long drive, stopping only for gas or breaks at rest stops, which I found each had a security guard. Eventually, we reached Louisiana and turned west through Baton Rouge, then south until we reached White Castle.</p>

<p>Some rain started after we left Baton Rouge and became fairly heavy as we parked at Nottoway Plantation. Fortunately, the tour would stay indoors, so we got tickets. Before touring, though, we went to the restaurant Randolph Hall on the premises to eat lunch. Three of just had the gumbo while my dad had something more substantial. Finished with that, we entered the plantation house and got greeted by a guide, who gave us paper towels with which to dry ourselves.</p>

<p>The tour started with the history of the place and we soon moved from the entrance hall into the gentlemen's smoking room. I found out that the last owner of the house lived there until her death a couple years ago, even as tours started in the 1980s. More people joined us as we entered the Grand White Ballroom. It had a portrait at one end that always seemed to look at me. We stopped to look at the dining room and glimpsed at the kitchen before going upstairs.</p>

<p>We passed some people relaxing on the balcony as we looked outside to the view of the nearby Boy's Wing. Here, the guide pointed out that the house now serves as a bed and breakfast. Back inside, we looked at the Music Room with its instruments, then headed out again for a look at the levee and the Mississippi River. The guided tour ended with a look at the bedrooms. Then, we went to the basement to look at some Civil War artifacts.</p>

<p>The rain had gone when we left the house, so I took outdoor pictures. Soon after, we left the place and started towards New Orleans. We passed views of petrochemical plants and waited once for a long train as we got to Interstate 10. Just before the city, I enjoyed being on the part of the highway on the edge of Lake Pontchartrain. We dealt with heavy traffic near the Superdome before we finally reached our hotel, the Fairmont New Orleans.</p>

<p>After we checked in and the valet took the minivan, we went to our rooms. I had a view of Canal Street. Then, we headed down to the TPAA Reception in the Grand Ballroom. I found the food there lacking in quality, but found my friends Joe and Pebbles. We talked for a while and took pictures, then Pebbles had to go. Joe invited me to check out Bourbon Street with him and we went after I stopped to drop stuff off at my hotel room.</p>

<p>We stepped out into the warm, humid evening and soon got to Bourbon Street, where we found a large crowd of people. Along the street we saw plenty of clubs, bars, shops and restaurants and noticed a highly visible police presence on foot and horseback. I quickly passed through the too crowded area of the Southern Decadence Festival as well as protesters of it to get relief in the lightly crowded residential section of the street. We then went back in the riverside direction to reach Preservation Hall.</p>

<p>A five dollar cover charge got us into the cozy, rustic hall. We stood and watched a live jazz band play some good traditional music. During their break, we sat down and listened through a couple more songs before leaving. Then, we got back to the hotel, where I decided to go to my room and sleep.</p>
