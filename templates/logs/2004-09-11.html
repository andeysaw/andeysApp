<p>I woke up the earliest of everybody, as far as I could tell, and took a look outside the window to find a lovely view of the Nooksack River flowing by, surrounded by a lush forest. Eventually, everybody got up and got ready. I went to a small, local store with Ariana to get a few things for breakfast, then we ate at the condo. The kids wanted to go outside to check out the river, so we went.</p>

<p>The kids and I took an easy stroll beside the river, stopping to look at it a couple times. We also looked around the outside of a wooden building that turned out to be the Adult Center. We looped back near the condominium units to get to our place. Then, we went out again on almost the same walk, this time with my sister and Billy. Without the kids, I checked out the Adult Center, which was just a quiet refuge from children.</p>

<p>A long drive down the windy highway led us back to Bellingham, where we made stops at Costco and Petco. They just wanted to see if the pet store had any ferrets. After getting some fast food, we headed into Ferndale, looking for Hovander Homestead Park. With some assistance, we found out we had to turn back the way we came. Soon, we arrived there and the everybody started walking to the big red barn.</p>

<p>Inside the barn and near it sat old farm equipment. We found a tower close to there that Liam and I climbed to see the overall view of place. After walking by the farmhouse, we checked out the animals. Liam really paid attention to the poultry. The place had really big rabbits. We also saw goats and smelly pigs. Three horses stood together behind an electric fence. When we finished our exploring, we took the car to closeby Tennant Lake Park.</p>

<p>At the park, the kids and I briefly went through the interpretive center, then met up with my sister and Billy at the lookout tower. Liam and I climbed this one for a view of the lake. Ariana opted to stay at the bottom and manipulate the view cameras from a console with video screens. Unfortunately, the boardwalk to the lakeshore was closed due it being hunting season. We checked out the Fragrance Garden, the only thing left to see, finding an interesting smell here and there.</p>

<p>Jumping onto the interstate, we headed south and exited at Fairhaven to take Chuckanut Drive. From that scenic drive, we got occasional lovely views of Puget Sound. We made a quick stop by the waterside at Larrabee State Park and watched kayakers in Samish Bay as they docked at the boat ramp. At a stop to check out Karma Place Japanese Gardens, we noticed paragliders passing directly above us, then landing at a nearby field.</p>

<p>After they did a little shopping and feeding the fish in the coi pond, we finished the scenic drive and headed back north on the interstate to Bellingham. We went to the small Bellis Fair Mall so that my sister could do some shopping. When done with that, we drove back to the condo to relax, watch a DVD on my sister's laptop computer and cook and eat dinner. We slept sometime after that.</p>
