<p>After work, I drove over to Chris' place where he loaded his gear into my car. We then took off across the Bay Bridge, then took the Caldecott Tunnel to I-680 to avoid reported slow traffic on I-80. When I-680 merged with I-80, we saw a traffic jam and decided to take the route that went through Suisun Valley then past part of Lake Berryessa.</p>

<p>For his dinner, Chris picked up a sandwich at Subway in Winters. I continued to chew on some tasty bread I got earlier. We stopped for fuel in Willows and admired the Klamath River at a rest stop near the border with Oregon. Heavy traffic caused by construction slowed us down after Medford, but we got to Valley of the Rogue State Park to set up camp before midnight.</p>
