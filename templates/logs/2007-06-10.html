<p>We all had to get up early for our shore excursion on our second day at the Russian port. We got to the buffet on deck 11 soon after it opened for breakfast. We then got organized in the Celebrity Theater to get on the correct tour bus. We got the first bus of several. We quickly and easily obtained our shore passes and headed out of St. Petersburg, passing by the Moscow Gate. We eventually reached Catherine Palace in the suburb of Pushkin.</p>

<p>We disembarked by a bust of Pushkin and headed to the large gate that admited us into the courtyard. The north side of the palace stood before us, with smaller wings surrounding the courtyard. A band played for us as we entered the palace at the main staircase. We climbed the stairs and then proceeded through the extravagent Baroque-style rooms, starting with the Great Hall with a ceiling painting. Then we saw dining rooms and other smaller rooms.</p>

<p>Each room had full furnishings, such as fully set tables, and fine paintings of royalty. Each section had different color schemes. The picture hall had paintings connected together like wallpaper. Unfortunately, we had to pass through the small Chinese rooms quickly due to our large group size. We returned to the main staircase then had to use the toilet before going out the south side into the garden for a good view of the building.</p>

<p>Our guide led us to a nearby souvenir shop. I looked at the displays of jeweled objects and then went outside with Steven and Alisa. Alisa bought a hat with pins from an outside stand and tried it on. After a while, we boarded the bus for a short ride to a restaurant for lunch. We sat at the large tables and got served a set Russian meal starting with borscht. A lively band arrived to dance and sing for us. My dad joined them for a brief time.</p>

<p>The tour bus would next take us to Peterhof. We got stuck in traffic, though. Our guide mentioned that president Putin was in town for an Economic Summit, meaning some area roads got closed for security reasons. This problem did not last too long and we got moving again, passing the pretty Peter and Paul Cathedral just before parking on the grounds of Peterhof Palace. After a short toilet break, we entered the lower gardens.</p>

<p>A large fountain with columns and a statue greeted us. Then, we continued down a path with tall tree hedges to find a different fountain. As we continued towards the palace, the scenery and number of fountains multiplied until we reached the stunning Great Cascade. Gold statues spouting water lined large steps. We did not stay here long, unfortunately, and continued up to the palace and upper gardens. We then went inside and put on plastic shoe covers.</p>

<p>I found the lavish interior of Peterhof Palace very impressive. Each set of rooms differed in style and color. Paintings hung all over the place, including a room with walls plastered with portraits of one young lady in different settings. We could not take photos in one room covered in fragile amber pieces. On our way out I saw photographs of massive damage to the palace done in World War II and its later meticulous restoration.</p>

<p>We passed a souvenir shop then found ourselves outside with a tremendous view just above the Great Cascade. A crowd gathered around a guy selling decorated egg shells, but I spent most my time enjoying the ornate statues and fountains. We had a little trouble finding Alisa's dad as we left, but then spotted him while on the bus. While trying to return to the ship, we encountered a roadblock related to the Economic Summit.</p>

<andeys-trip-pic class="right" data-trip-pic="picture-hall"></andeys-trip-pic>

<p>For what seemed a long time, our bus and many others waited at the roadblock. The officer blocking the intersection told our guide that the road would remain closed for more than an hour. However, our bus driver went to the officer and convinced him to let us through while following a fire truck. No other vehicles got through. I saw armed guards at every intersection on the closed road. Finally, we reached St. Petersburg, passing Triumphal Arch.</p>

<p>Being a bit late for boarding, we got onto the cruise ship quickly. We returned just in time for our scheduled dinner in the Grand Restaurant. Through the captain's announcements over the intercom, I found out the later times the rest of the buses arrived. The ship got going as soon as everybody boarded. When I went outside I could see black smoke from the hard-working engine. I watched as we left port and spotted a cooling tower in Russian flag colors.</p>

<p>Just out of curiosity, I briefly checked out people playing shuffleboard on deck 6 starboard, then went to the art gallery to guess artist quotes on a sheet of paper and claim the gift of another lithograph. I decided to see the night's featured entertainment, so sat down in the Celebrity Theater to watch comedian Jeff Nease. He seemed just okay. His aimed his jokes for the elderly crowd. Indeed, the ship seemed to have mostly retirees.</p>

<p>After the show, I checked on my brother and found him with Alisa watching anime as I expected. I wandered the ship a bit after that and also took time to read about events and the port for the next day. The Crystal Room held a Chocolate Buffet late in the evening, so I took a look inside but decided not to wait in long lines for treats. I went back to the room instead to get ready to sleep, first looking outside to see the sky still light near midnight.</p>
