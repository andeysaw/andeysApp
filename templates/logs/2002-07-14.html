<p>We woke up, got ready for the day, packed our bags, checked out and left our bags in storage. Doing all that left little time for breakfast, so we only had a chance for a quick pineapple drink before leaving for our tour. The tour guides separated a moderately large group of people into different trucks, each with a guide. Our truck had my brother and I, a German couple and the Japanese woman we met the day before.</p>

<p>We entered Khao Yai National Park and made our first stop at a viewpoint high over the area where we saw bats the day before. Soon after that, we spotted Pig-tailed Macaques on the road and in the surrounding vegetation. They seemed to be the most common animal to see in the daytime.</p>

<p>We reached the visitor center and had some time there, so my brother and I took a brief hike to find Gong Gheo Falls. It turned out to be an unimpressive cascade on the river. We then returned to the visitor center to look at a few of the displays about the park and other ones in Thailand. When we went back outside, we found our group putting on leech proof socks, so we did as well.</p>

<p>We drove off to a spot to start hiking, but as we began the trail, we went back to the road because someone spotted a White-handed Gibbon. I got there in time to see it high up in the tree. It then swung away and a few people tried to keep track of the fast swinging primate but lost it. We then went back onto the trail.</p>

<p>I delighted in hearing the sounds of many macaques and gibbons making noise as we took an unsigned trail with our guide. At one point I heard the displacement of large amounts of air as a Great Hornbill flew over us. I barely glimpsed it through the trees. We also spotted several macaques near the ground and a couple more gibbons in the trees.</p>

<p>Later in the hike, we checked out some impressive old Banyan Trees, their aerial roots creating enormous trunks full of holes. We then passed by the red, exposed earth of an elephant lick as we reached our goal, a watchtower. We went up the steps and then sat on the benches to enjoy the view. At one point the guide showed us three leeches that got on his socks, including a tiny younger one. Nobody else seemed to have attracted any.</p>

<p>After resting up, we only had one kilometer to walk until we reached the new place our truck parked. We drove off, picked up and dropped off who I assumed were friends of the driver or the guide, then made an unexpected stop at some commotion. As I approached the scene, I saw creatures running off that I later found out were called Asian Pangolins. Our guide told us that authorities released a confiscated shipment from a smuggling operation and that the creatures live natively in the south. Pangolins just released stayed curled up in protective balls, then cautiously peeked their heads out, uncurling and leaving only when they felt safe.</p>

<p>We left that area and had lunch at an open air restaurant. As we ate, the guide pointed out a camouflaged snake just relaxing in the tree nearby us. Fortunately, it presented no danger to us. After finishing and relaxing a bit, the guide took us on a walk where we encountered a guy playing with a bear. The guide told me this bear, a Malayan Sun Bear, becamed an orphan when little, so the restaurant owner raised him. As I took a picture, he ran up to me and grabbed me, but quickly let go, doing me no harm.</p>

<p>After watching the small bear chase someone up a tree for fun, the guide led us down a path to a view of the big and gorgeous Haew Suwat Waterfall. We enjoyed the sight for a while, then returned back up the steps. We also checked out the view from the top of the waterfall. During this time, my brother conversed with the Japanese woman, mostly in Japanese. As we left, the German girl saw a leech on my pants, but the guide took it off before it ever attached to my skin.</p>

<p>For the last part of the tour, we drove uphill and then did a short hike until we reached a wonderful viewpoint of the tropical forest, at an elevation of 1200 meters. We took pictures, then returned to the truck and eventually left the park. I talked with the German couple and when we got to the lodge, asked the guy, Christian, if I could look at his German Euros. I ended up getting a 50, 20 and 10 cent Euro coin from him in exchange for a U.S. golden dollar, regular half dollar and Tennessee quarter.</p>

<p>We got our bags from the storage room, then took the minibus to the bus station with other people. Immediately from there, we got on a crowded bus going back to Bangkok. Unlike the bus to Pak Chong, it got packed enough that several people had to stand, including my brother for a while. Though I sat in the back behind people, I managed to watch some of the Thai show on the television by looking at a reflection of the screen on the window.</p>

<p>We got to the northern bus terminal in Bangkok in good time and took a taxi from there to the Radisson Hotel, where we had made an advanced reservation. We picked up the luggage we had held there while in Australia and, after dinner at the hotel and a good shower, spent time repacking our bags, because we had to bring everything with us to Japan. We slept after finishing.</p>
