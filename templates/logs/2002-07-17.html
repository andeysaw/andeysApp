<p>After waking up and getting ready for the day, we headed out. On the way down the stairs, we met Yuhara-san, who asked if we were going to the day's parade, the Yamaboko Junko (part of the Gion Festival). When we said yes, she generously gave us help in getting a good seat to see it. As we left, a woman named Elaine came out and asked if she could tag along on our way there.</p>

<p>We took a bus north and then stopped at a bakery to eat breakfast. It began to rain hard outside and we worried about the possibility of the parade cancelling, because we were on the fringe of Super Typhoon Halong. After eating, we went ahead anyway to our seating area and found people still gathering for the parade.</p>

<p>My brother and I found a good front seat as workers set up the chairs. We had an excellent view of the corner of Kawaramachi-dori and Oike-dori. However, we had no cover above, which meant that we had to use our umbrellas and ponchos to stay dry. On time, the parade of floats made their way down around the corner.</p>

<p>Basically, we saw two types of floats, the hoko and the yama, both wheeled and pulled by teams of people. They both showed beautiful decorations with precious rugs and sometimes presented images from Japanese literature or plays. The yama tended to be the smaller ones and could be lifted by the pulling team for turning. Turning the floats around full circle drew applause. One team turned their float around twice near the end.</p>

<p>The hoko tended to have two stories, the second one filled with musicians playing traditional piccolo-like festival music. On the roof sat a couple more people. Attached to the top, hokos either had a really long, decorated pole or a pine tree. In the front stood two people with fans who commanded the pullers, saying a chant and pointing the fans in the direction desired.</p>

<p>The hoko had two big wheels that could not turn, so a whole process went underway to turn the float. The pullers would take bamboo poles from the storage space under the float and lay them on the ground. They would then move the float onto some of the poles and make the float turn with a sideways pull. In usually three turns the float would have moved about ninety degrees. They would then put the poles back and resume pulling. Two people with wedge blocks would stay just ahead of the wheels to straighten the float further if needed.</p>

<p>The rain lessened and then disappeared as the parade progressed. Later floats had some of their clear plastic protection removed for a better view of the designs. My brother kept track of the float names, reading each description as they passed. In about two and a half hours the parade ended and we went to a small restaurant nearby called Kyohei for some ramen. I didn't like it much and didn't finish.</p>

<p>From there, we took a bus to reach Ryoan Temple, known for its classic Zen rock garden. As we entered, we first came upon pretty Kyoyochi Pond with its many lily pads. Then, we went into a building to see the rock garden, completed in 1499. It had fifteen stones in a field of raked white gravel, with one stone always hidden from any single vantage point. Adjacent to it lay a pretty moss garden that my brother said he particularly enjoyed.</p>

<p>After exploring the rest of the paths on the grounds, we exited and walked a bit until we got to Kinkaku Temple. Right after we entered, we saw its best known and beautiful sight, the Golden Pavillion, wonderfully reflected in Kyoko Pond. The second and third floors were covered in gold leaf on Japanese lacquer. We continued on to see the gardens, a smaller pond with a small stone pagoda and a classic tea house.</p>

<p>We left with no time to see other temples, so we took a bus that got us to the Shinkyogoku Covered Arcade. My brother saw an anime store called Animate last time we passed by and wanted to shop there during its business hours. I looked around with only passing interest while my brother bought a few items. We also stopped at a sock store so he could buy special socks for his friends, including super loose socks. Returning back north along the Teramachi Covered Arcade the next street over, I got the chance to look inside a Pachinko parlor, where I only briefly looked at the gambling machines. We also made a quick side trip to the Nishiki food market only to find it closed.</p>

<p>For dinner, we walked nearby to Okonomiyaki Mai. The place only served okonomiyaki, which looked like a really thick pancake with a sauce approaching the taste of barbecue sauce. The place only had Japanese menus, but my brother had no problem reading them and ordered for us with the ingredients we wanted in the batter. Then, they put the food with those items on the iron hot plate on our table for us to eat while it continued to cook. It tasted better as it became more cooked.</p>

<p>While eating, we noticed a big crowd of people passing by on the street, chanting one thing. We noticed it again as we paid our bill and quickly went outside to see what went on. I found out I saw a part of the Gion Festival known as Sinko-Sai, where men honorably carry on their shoulders three sacred carriages through the streets. We tried to follow for a bit, trying a separate street to avoid the crowd, but missed them.</p>

<p>We ended up by the Zest Underground Arcade, so checked it out, only to find closed shops. We then got on a bus to get back to our ryokan, but got delayed by the procession of carriages coming through in front. When we finally did get back, we took our Japanese style baths and slept.</p>
