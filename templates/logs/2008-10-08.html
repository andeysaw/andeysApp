<p>Wanting to get back to Orange County by late afternoon, we woke up at 5 AM and broke camp. We drove a scenic route through the saguaro cacti until we reached I-10 and then continued to I-8. We got fuel in Gila Bend at a place with many decorative items for sale. After Yuma, we passed through a border checkpoint. Then, the truck stalled right before the next checkpoint near US-98, right in front of Homeland Security. Fortunately, we managed to get to the side of the freeway.</p>

<p>Looking under the hood, Craig determined we would take the rest of the drive in the hot weather with no air conditioning. We fueled up again in El Centro, then took a break at the Buckman Springs Rest Area. We passed one more checkpoint before Julian. We got a sea breeze in Carlsbad as we stopped for lunch in Carl's Jr. I got a Six Dollar Burger for half price with Joey's coupon. Finally, we fueled in Lake Forest and reached Craig's house. I left for my home soon after.</p>
