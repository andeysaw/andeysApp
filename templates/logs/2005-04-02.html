<p>We got up and ready early enough to get the complimentary breakfast in the motel office just as it became available. Then, we left town, taking the initially super straight highway 374 back to Death Valley National Park. Back in California, we headed towards Furnace Creek while gawking at the widespread fields of yellow and purple flowers surrounding Beatty Cutoff and highway 190. We wanted to make it to the ranger guided wildflower walk, so we didn't stop until we got to the Visitor Center.</p>

<p>I used my National Park Pass to get a valid parking permit for the park while Ben and Arlene looked at the gift shop and the Death Valley Museum. I saw those museum exhibits before except for pictures of damage from the flash floods of the previous summer and a video slide show of wildflowers found in the park. A big crowd soon gathered in the patio area to hear a ranger talk about local wildflowers. The ranger took us to see flowers in the garden, introducing us to several interesting flowers with a notable warning about touching notch-leaf phacelia.</p>

<p>The dominant flower by far in the valley was desert gold. Among them stood plenty of purple phacelias and white gravel ghosts. A close look at the desert floor got us noticing some tiny flowers almost next to the ground. We took a few photos near Furnace Creek, then headed south to Badwater, wanting to visit the lowest point in the western hemisphere during the relatively cool morning. This would be my first visit since the new parking lot and boardwalk got constructed.</p>

<p>A big crowd had gathered at Badwater with most of the people heading out on the salt flat to see the large, temporary lake created by the relatively abundant winter rains. After checking out the spring-fed Badwater Pool, we also went out to the lake, enjoying the views of the water and the snowy Panamint Mountain Range. We returned to the car then drove the dirt road to the Natural Bridge parking lot, where we found plenty of flowers and a great view of the basin below. Part of the mountains got reflected in the lake.</p>

<p>We enjoyed the scenery, then walked into a canyon until we reached the Natural Bridge formation. I enjoyed going between the steep walls and saw a couple of dry falls along the way, created when flood waters from higher up tributary canyons flowed through. A few purple flowers grew in cracks at the edge of the walls. We took in the great view on our walk back out then got out of the crowded parking lot and headed north.</p>

<p>We stopped at Furnace Creek quickly to find out if the desert pupfish were active at Salt Creek, then made our way there, taking a dirt road to the parking lot. First, we ate our lunch of Vietnamese sandwiches, then got out onto the boardwalk. Immediately, we saw large schools of little fish darting around in the shallow creek. We walked the entire boardwalk trail to look for more fish, but found most of them in the shallow areas close to the trailhead. After more observing of the pupfish, we got back in the car and headed further north to the mouth of Titus Canyon.</p>

<p>We parked the car and started walking along the path that eventually leads to Fall Canyon. Here we found a much lower density of flowers than in the lower part of the valley, but we noticed some that we did not see earlier. Also, we saw a better concentration of the beautiful desert five-spot flowers. Soon, we walked back to the parking lot, then went a little bit into Titus Canyon to admire its steep walls. It looked like quite the deep gash in the Grapevine Mountains.</p>

<p>On our way back south, we made a stop at the Information stand by the Kit Fox Hills to get in some flower pictures with the hills as backdrop. We took a group picture among the desert gold flowers and I went photographed a couple of the low-to-the-ground &ldquo;belly crawler&rdquo; flowers. Then, we continued south and stopped at Furnace Creek one more time to go to the Borax Museum. Nearby at the General Store afterwards, Ben and Arlene bought a souvenir t-shirt.</p>

<p>We continued south, passing badwater and enjoying more views of flowers and the salt flats. The sun set as we passed the ruins of Ashford Mill and started east through Jubilee and Salsberry Pass to the town of Shoshone. Originally, we had wanted to find food to eat at Shoshone, but found only gas station fare and passed on that. However, we did end up having to purchase at least enough fuel to make it to Beatty and got the lowest grade, priced at $3.099 a gallon.</p>

<p>We went north and arrived earlier than we had originally planned at the Amargosa Opera House and Hotel in the tiny town of Death Valley Junction. We checked out the hotel, enjoying the murals in the dining room and browsing the gift shop. I bought our reserved tickets for the performance and then we waited at the entrance to the opera house. A little bat above the entrance attracted the interest of the waiting crowd.</p>

<p>As soon as we entered the theater and presented our tickets, we and other people started taking pictures of the walls and ceilings highly decorated with artwork by Marta Becket. She had painted a sixteenth century Spanish audience that included royalty, monks, nuns, gypsies and revelers. Below the painted balconies stood guards and performing native Americans. On the ceiling were dancing cherubs. Some parts of the murals did show some wear.</p>

<p>The two person theater operation started with Tom Willet making an introduction for the play <em>Masquerade.</em> Then, a recorded voice of Marta Becket detailed the history of the theater in this remote town and the Marta, who revived it and performed in it for decades. The show started and we saw several short skits of Tom and Marta being people at the &ldquo;masquerade&rdquo; pretending to be someone else for the evening. I saw that they had some fun with the play and did not take it too seriously, especially with handling the low budget props.</p>

<p>The play ended with some announcements by Tom and then Marta came out to talk to the audience and sign autographs. We left the theater and entered the Music Room Tom had just mentioned where we saw the player piano Tom had built from an antique piano and its accompagning accordian. He had it play four songs for us. We also checked out the grandfather clock Tom built as well as Red Skelton paintings hanging on the wall.</p>

<p>We left the little town and re-entered Nevada, reaching Beatty in under an hour. There, we headed for the Stagecoach Hotel and Casino, where we ate a small, late dinner at Rita's Cafe. I'm glad I didn't order a full dish because I had eaten plenty of snacks in the car. Exhausted after the long day, we returned to the Phoenix Inn, showered and slept.</p>
