<p>I had pretty much the day to myself and, after waking up, I walked through the French Quarter to Jackson Square. After admiring the view of St. Louis Cathedral and the statue of Andrew Jackson on horseback, I stopped at Caf&eacute; Du Monde for hot chocolate and their beignets overly covered with powdered sugar. Then, I went to the entrance to the French Quarter Visitor Center of Jean Laffite National Historical Park and Preserve to wait for it to open.</p>

<p>I got one of the limited free passes to get the historic tour of the Vieux Carr&eacute; or French Quarter. With time until the tour, I perused the exhibits in the center about the culture of the region. The tour started with a walk to the riverfront, where the guide talked about the beginnings of the city. Then, we moved into the Vieux Carr&eacute; to stop at increasingly newer buildings as our guide continued to talk about the history of the place.</p>

<p>Significant tour stops included the Napolean Building, which Napeleon never visited, pirate and smuggler Jean Lafitte's Blacksmith Shop, the Crazy Corner on Bourbon Street and the shady garden behind St. Louis Cathedral. I decided to do the self-guided tour recommended in the AAA book after the historic one ended, to see more of the architecture. After Jackson Square, I headed north through the crowded French Market past a statue of Joan of Arc.</p>

<p>When I reached the Old U.S. Mint, I noticed a little Thai restaurant in a Spanish style building, but didn't go in. Instead, I continued past the the Old Ursuline Covenant, built in 1745, then saw fine buildings such as the Beauregard-Keyes House, Soniat Hotel, the Lalaurie House and the Labranche Building. I stopped for a picture of Preservation Hall and the imposing, out of place Civil Courts Buildings before returning to Jackson Square.</p>

<p>For lunch, I made my way to the Central Grocery Company on Decatur Street, where I bought a sandwich known as a muffaletta. I took it back to the air conditioned comfort of my hotel room to relax and eat it. It tasted fairly good. My parents arrived there and relaxed too as well as got ready for their TPAA Gala Dinner. I went out again, first to drop off film for processing, then to get the minivan. My dad got something out of the car, then I left south for the Barataria Preserve.</p>

<p>When I reached the visitor center of the preserve, I got information on short hikes I could do. Soon, I made my way to Bayou Coquille, where I saw the swamp. I walked on the sometimes boardwalk path until I reached the Lower Kenta Canal. There, sometimes with the help of a local, I spotted several alligators partially hidden in the marsh. One of them seemed to look at me as I looked at it. I left the area after finishing the trail.</p>

<p>Back in New Orleans, I picked up my photos and dropped off one newly finished roll, then returned to the hotel room. During this time, Joe called me to update me on a dinner he had arranged with him and two young women. He kept stating a later time to meet, which worked out for me. I picked up my roll of film just before meeting with them. I found out one girl, Rana, I met three years ago and the other, Patavee, was a childhood friend of my sister.</p>

<p>Soon, a friend of theirs named Jarrod and his wife Tammy picked us up in his car and took us to Jaeger's Seafood Beer Garden, situated right on the shore of Lake Pontchartrain. We shared a delicious dinner of crab, shrimp, crawfish, oysters and more. Outside in the back, we noticed a kind of party atmosphere, but we stayed indoors. After that great meal, we got back to the hotel, where I had to get to the show that came after the TPAA Gala Dinner.</p>

<p>I arrived at the Imperial Ballroom just in time for the intentionally cheesy performance for amusement that included my dad. One by one, TPAA members dressed unconvincingly as stars such as Michael Jackson, Tina Turner and Madonna came out, lipsyncing to songs. My dad arrived last in his new Elvis Presley costume he purchased in Memphis. After seeing the show, Joe and Patavee planned to go out to Bourbon Street, but I decided to get some rest for the long drive the next day.</p>
