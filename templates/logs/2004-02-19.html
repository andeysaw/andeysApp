<p>We woke up early and put our stuff into the car, then ate the complimentary breakfast our hotel offered. Right after that, we checked out and headed for the international border. Not quite knowing the way, I found myself heading for the border on route 15, but then figured out how to reach route 99. I did this so that we could stop at the Peace Arch.</p>

<p>Just before reaching the border, I found the exit to the parking area for Peace Arch Provincial Park. We left the car, crossed the road and reached the Peace Arch to take a few pictures on both sides. Then, we got back to the car and went to U.S. Customs. After only a few questions from the officer, we passed through and continued down south to Seattle.</p>

<p>I parked near the Seattle Center and we headed for the Monorail Station, getting a good look at the Experience Music Project and Space Needle on the way. The quick Monorail ride brought us to Westlake Center, where we descended to the metro bus tunnel for a free bus ride to Pioneer Square. We first stopped by the ticket office for Bill Speidel's Underground Tour and bought tickets for the next tour. Having time before then, we then went out to walk around the historic district and eat lunch at a Greek place called Mediterranean Mix.</p>

<p>We checked out a Tlingit totem pole and bust of Chief Seattle, then went to the tour meeting place. It started with the tour group sitting in a restored 1890s saloon, where the guide spent some time introducing us to the history of the Seattle underground. He gave a spirited talk about the half thought-out ideas that created a town with sewage problems due to tide flooding and streets poorly landfilled with sawdust. Finally, town planners decided to raise the sidewalk levels and later the businesses followed.</p>

<p>The tour took us out onto the street, so we had to wear identifying stickers. Soon, we went through a door and down stairs into the underground, where we found the decaying remains of a store. We walked through there and the former storefront while the guide continued his talk. Going up stairs and into an alley to more stairs down, we entered an old bank vault that used to have a skylight. We then saw a still existing skylight.</p>

<p>One more up and down and we ended the tour below the ticket office. There, we saw a small display of exhibits related to the history of Seattle's underground and a gift shop. We looked around and then exited to the modern street level. After a brief stop at the Elliot Bay bookstore and its cafe, we took a look at the nearby Klondike Gold Rush National Historic Park. Inside, we looked at exhibits and saw part of a film that got us sleepy. We realized we became quite tired when not moving around.</p>

<p>A short free ride north using the metro bus tunnel plus a walk west got us to Pike Place Market. Mostly, we walked around taking a look at the displays at stands and shops. Also, we enjoyed views of Puget Sound. HaoFeng tried some cheap fried chicken thigh that he really liked, so I tried some afterwards. At one end, I found the original Starbucks shop and took a photo of the old mermaid logo. When done looking around, we headed to the Seattle Art Museum and its huge Hammering Man moving sculpture.</p>

<p>We entered the museum and went first for the special exhibit by Christian Marclay. I saw displays of different album covers pasted together to create interesting images and some exaggerated instruments like a drum set really spread out vertically and a super long accordian. Inside a curtained room I witnessed a four screen ensemble of changing images of people from movies through the decades making musical and vocal noises.</p>

<p>Upstairs one level we saw more traditional art of various cultures, starting with the carvings of the natives of the Northwest Coast. We then walked through exhibits of African artifacts and smaller rooms for others. The Japanese and Chinese rooms each had displays showing the setup and architecture of traditional rooms. On the top level, we found Mediterranean and European art, then finished with American and modern art. HaoFeng did not make any sense at all of the minimalist art.</p>

<p>On our way out, we stopped to enjoy a jazz band in the lobby. The museum wanted to create a social atmosphere during its Thursday evening late openings. The free bus in the metro bus tunnel then the Monorail took us back to Seattle Center. We passed through the food court there, but didn't stay to eat, going for the car to drive to Volunteer Park.</p>

<p>I ended up taking some small roads to the park, but eventually found the Seattle Asian Art Museum. It also stayed open late Thursday and I got to use the ticket I bought at the other museum. There, we saw a great long scroll of what HaoFeng told me was basically an artistally illustrated Chinese cookbook. After that, we looked mostly at great examples of Buddhist sculpture and some beautiful ceramics.</p>

<p>Done with a long day of sightseeing, we headed to Everett to check into a Motel 6 there. Once in our room, we had a simple dinner of noodles using HaoFeng's water heater. We also watched some television, showered and slept.</p>
