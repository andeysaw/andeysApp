<p>We had a morning mixed with errands and sightseeing. While our laundry got cleaned in the washing machines at the campground, we went off to see the domes of the Ukranian Cathedral of Saint George. Then, we returned to camp to put our clothes in the dryers and left again to shop for trip supplies at Extra Foods.</p>

<p>When we finished with errands, we headed northeast to Wanuskewin Heritage Park. First, after entering the visitor centre, we took a look at historic photographs of tribal communities. Then, we entered the main theatre to watch a film about the land. A woman in the film talked about connecting with the spirit of her ancestors on this land. In between segments showed park pictures with the voice of a man saying, &ldquo;What does Wanuskewin mean to you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>After the film, we headed into the main exhibit room to look at tribal artifacts and displays with explanations of traditional tribal life. Touch screens interactively educated people about things such as what materials to select for a good wigwam or how one makes a traditional flute. I walked into one of the wigwams and found it dark inside with some chanting music. I pressed a button and the audio changed. To my surprise, I heard people in there getting up, probably from napping. I quickly got out before they noticed my presence (as far as I could tell). They left the wigwam soon after.</p>

<p>Another room in the centre had information about the archeological work being done at Wanuskewin. It had a window to an archeology lab belonging to the University of Saskatchewan, empty at the time we looked in. The final room had information about modern tribal life with videos you could select to play. I also pressed some buttons to hear samples of the same phrase said in different tribal languages.</p>

<p>After checking out a small display in the art gallery, we went outside to check out the trails. We walked on the Trail of Discovery first, but did not find any dig site or archeology tent mentioned on the park map. Next, we tried the Trail of the Buffalo, where we got a good view of the South Saskatchewan River and a deer by its banks. We also touched a stone worn smooth by thousands of bison that once passed it.</p>

<p>Getting hungry, we returned to the visitor centre to eat at the restaurant. We wanted to try tribal food, but found regular food like burgers, sandwiches and soups just with bison meat subsituted for cattle meat. We finished our meal quickly enough to get to the scheduled tribal dance performance at the amphitheatre.</p>

<p>The announcer spoke first, while waiting for the dancer to arrive. He told us how busy dancers could get with various functions such as pow-wows and for how long they sometimes ended up dancing. He also asked the sparse crowd where they came from. One group had visited from as far as the United Kingdom.</p>

<p>The dancer arrived in her traditional dress and gave us a sample of a couple of the dances done at pow-wows, while two guys beat on small hand-held drums. Her toddler son watched, holding a bottle of water for his mom. After they finished, they invited everyone to join together in a group dance, and we did, trying out the steps as we held hands to whoever stood next to us. That finished the presentation.</p>

<p>My brother and I went ahead and finished the rest of the park trails afterwards. The Path of the People trail passed a cliff once used for driving bison off to kill them and also passed wigwams that people could arrange to stay in overnight. Splitting from that, the Circle of Harmony trail led us to the remains of a medicine wheel, its stones barely visible in the grass. We left the park after finishing the loops.</p>

<p>Driving south, I passed Saskatoon and, after a while, realized I took the wrong road to my destination. Fortunately, I didn't have too long of an alternate way to go, but that road, Route 15, felt pretty bumpy. When we reached the town of Manitou Springs, we stopped at the tiny welcome centre and found that, if we wanted to see the lake there, we could just go anywhere along the town shore. I had read that Little Manitou Lake was dense enough to easily float upon.</p>

<p>When we parked by the shore, we found the lake gorgeously reflecting the partly cloudy sky. I mentioned the beautiful lake to some other guy with a camera and he responded with a big &ldquo;Eh?&rdquo; and said sights like that were uncommon in the province. We seriously thought about taking a dip in it and even both changed into swim trunks. We got to the edge and, after feeling its cold water and seeing some floating plant material, changed our minds. However, we did spot someone else in the water, floating on it with a full wetsuit on.</p>

<p>Getting back in the car with our clothes changed back, we drove south for a while. Unexpectedly, the farm landscape changed into the lovely rolling hills of the Qu'Appelle Valley. It changed back as we left that area and we soon reached Moose Jaw, going to the south end of town to the River Park Campground. Campsites felt a little closer than I preferred, but I accepted it and we cooked dinner, showered and slept without problems.</p>
