<p>I awoke to a perception that the plane had started slightly descending and checked the status on the screen to find we did not have far to go. Our flight arrived on time so I knew I had time to spare before the first public bus left for D.C. I brushed my teeth and shaved in the restroom and then boarded one of the odd looking mobile lounges that got me slowly from the gates to the main terminal. There, I grabbed some free maps and brochures and checked out the AeroTrain exhibit showing a train that would soon replace the mobile lounges.</p>

<p>At curb 2E, I waited and then boarded the first Metro Bus 5A for the day. The driver drove fast and stopped so briefly at my planned stop of Rosslyn Metro Station that I didn't exit in time. On the way, the bus driver got out to find out why a police car blocked the exit ramp of the Capital Beltway and found out that the National Marathon was in progress. I exited at the L'Enfant Plaza Metro Station, where I bought a Metro 7-Day Fast Pass for unlimited rides for 7 days and then took the train to Glenmont Station in Maryland.</p>

<p>I called and got my friend Korn's friend Pong to take me to his place where I would stay during my trip. He had a modest house on a suburban street that he rented along with two others. The owners were in Thailand. He showed me my room where I dropped off my stuff and then he took me back to Glenmont Metro Station. From there, I took the train over to Metro Center and started exploring the area as I walked slowly towards the Treasury Building.</p>

<p>Through Freedom Plaza, I encountered the city's original plans engraved on the ground along with various quotes. I continued through Pershing Park and its statues until I reached the gate of the Treasury Building. From there, I took pictures and then checked out the view of the White House from the South Lawn gate. After getting some national park information from the Ellipse Visitor Pavilion, I visited the nearby White House Visitor Center, looking at its exhibits to pass the time.</p>

<p>After reading up about the White House, I then headed back to the Treasury Building. The guard ordered me back when I went to the gate though and I found I had to wait next to a sign by the street for my scheduled tour. Soon enough a woman walked out of the building and let us in once we each showed her identification. She started a talk on the steps and then we went inside for screening through a metal detector.</p>

<p>The tour covered parts of the second, third and fifth floor. We looked at historic photographs and portraits of past Secretaries of the Treasury as we passed them in the halls. I also looked up stairwells to see the various ceiling designs. We peered into the elegant Salmon P. Chase Room on the third floor and then looked through both doors into the Secretary's Conference and Diplomatic Reception Room, noting the portraits and nineteenth century furnishings.</p>

<p>The Andrew Johnson Suite had a mess on the desk that the guide attributed to the staff being busy working on the economic stimulus package. He also pointed out fossils in the marble floor and the one remaining open skylight. He led us up to the fifth floor to the top of the stairwell that had a lovely dome ceiling with a gold pattern and took us into a dark, cool meeting room to show how the building's roof shaped the ceiling of the room.</p>

<p>Back down to the second floor, we checked out the burglar-proof vault that now serves merely as a wall between offices. We picked up small souvenir bags of shredded cash at a desk there. We entered the large cash room next, where we admired the walls, the chandelier and the vault with heavy door in a side room that now only stored mundane supplies. We then went to the entrance that faces the White House where we saw posters of the different notes over time, including the $100,000 bill.</p>

<p>After exiting the Treasury Building, I decided to explore the neighborhood. I walked around to the north side of the Treasury Building and then got a view of the north side of the White House where I got someone to take my picture. I saw people playing street hockey between the White House and the Renwick Gallery. I continued west and south, noting the Corcoran Gallery, the Octagon House, the American Red Cross, Constitution Hall and the Art Museum of the Americas with its sculptures.</p>

<p>I found myself pretty close to the National World War II Memorial when I hit Constitution Avenue, so I headed on over to see its central fountain surrounded by pillars with stone wreaths representing states and territories involved in the war. One end had the Atlantic Pavilion and the other the Pacific Pavilion. I wandered around the entire memorial looking at the small and big design elements. Up on the other side of the 4,048 stars Freedom Wall, I found the engraving &ldquo;Kilroy Was Here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I felt a bit hungry, but didn't want to spend time eating and knew I would have a good dinner, so I bought a Polish dog from a stand near the Commerce Building and just stood around to eat the quick, bland meal. I also bought some postcards. I then returned to Metro Center, going to the customer service window to buy a Metrobus Weekly Pass for unlimited rides Sunday through Saturday. From there, I rode the train south to Smithsonian Station.</p>

<p>Right near the station exit I found the Freer Gallery of Art. After a quick bag search by security, I wandered around looking at the mostly Asian art collection, mainly religious sculptures. I found the fancy Peacock Room particularly impressive with its lavishly decorated peacock illustrations on the wall and mindful placements of paintings and ceramics. From an underground connection with paintings by Winslow Homer, I soon found my way into the Arthur M. Sackler Gallery where I found an exhibit about earthenware and stoneware ceramics from Southeast Asia.</p>

<p>Also at the Sackler Gallery, I saw the Tale of Shuten Doji exhibit with its many nineteenth century handscrolls illustrating the popular Japanese legend and a couple of odd video installations, one of them slowly and artfully showing a scene of women's Japanese archery. I thought of my sister and her archery. After that, I found an underground atrium with a tall, hanging sculpture of monkeys forming words in different languages. At the bottom, I found a passage to the Ripley Center.</p>

<p>I found the International Gallery there closed, instead walking a hallway showcasing beautiful photographs taken by Smithsonian employees. I ended up at the lowest level of the National Museum of African Art, where I found a colorful set of sculptures at the bottom of an atrium. Slowly, I made my way up the levels, checking out the galleries showcasing African sculpture. At the top, near the street entrance, I found a garment from Tanzania that had a message of congratulations to Barack Obama.</p>

<p>Exiting the building, I found myself at the small Enid A. Haupt Garden on the south end of the Smithsonian Castle. I looked at the central Parterre and then wandered around the Fountain Garden on the east side and the Moongate Garden on the west side. Inside the Castle, I asked about changes to the Smithsonian since my last visit in 2001 and then looked around. I found example exhibits from each museum and, inside the north entrance, the crypt of James Smithson.</p>

<p>Done with sightseeing for the day, but having some time to spare, I took a leisurely walk across the National Mall until I reached the Gallery Place-Chinatown Metro Station. I took the Metro to Glenmont Station where Korn and Pan picked me up. I met their two daughters for the first time as we headed to dinner at Hinode Japanese Restaurant in Rockville. We ordered the huge Fish Lovers for Two boat among other things and got quite stuffed.</p>

<p>They insisted on treating me for the big dinner because I came all that way to visit. We then left the restaurant and headed for Giant Food supermarket where I bought oatmeal and breakfast bars for quick meals in the upcoming mornings. I got dropped off at Pong's house next where I showered, did some organizing in preparation for the next day and wrote three postcards. I also received a text from my friend Pui and then went to sleep.</p>
