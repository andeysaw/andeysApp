<p>After waking up and breaking camp, my brother and I drove south towards the international border, timing it so we would get there not long after the Port of Oungre US Customs station opened. Unexpectedly, the road to get there was in poor shape, giving us quite a bumpy ride. I had read that agents at remote border crossings could give more trouble than main ones, simply out of boredom, but we got through only after a few questions. The road immediately got better after the station.</p>

<p>We drove through a land fairly empty looking of people until we reached Williston, where we filled up on gas. My brother, in surprise, spotted a DeLorean parking at one of the gas stations. We continued on south until we started seeing the eroded hills that told us we had reached the badlands area of the state. Soon, we entered the north unit of Theodore Roosevelt National Park, stopping first at the visitor center for advice on trails.</p>

<p>We decided to drive along the north unit's scenic road, stopping at almost every signed point of interest, starting with the Longhorn Pullout. At the Cannonball Concretions Pullout, we a large concretion shaped like a cannonball. We could see concretions of other shapes jutting out of the nearby cliff, erosion slowly exposing them. Soon after this stop, we encountered a group of bison milling about on the road, blocking both lanes. I waited a bit for them to leave, but they only started moving when I began slowly and carefully nudging the car forwards at them.</p>

<p>At the River Bend Overlook, we walked down to an old lookout built by the CCC to take our first look at the Little Missouri River as it made its way through the eroded hills. We next stopped for the view at the Bentonitic Clay Overlook then the Edge of Glacier Pullout and read the interpretive signs at both. Taking a cue from the name of the &ldquo;Man and Grass Pullout,&rdquo; I took a picture of my brother looking out at the grass.</p>

<p>The end of the road brought us to the Oxbow Overlook, where we parked and decided to try hiking to Sperati Point. We enjoyed the start of the hike, passing several purple coneflowers, but soon became unsure of the location of the point. It did not help that more than one trail showed up. Another pair of people we met also did not find the point, so we gave up and headed back to the car.</p>

<p>On the drive back towards the entrance, we chose to check out two more trails, starting with the Caprock Coulee Nature Trail. With a guide pamphlet in hand, we hiked the trail through the narrow valley to the end of the nature trail and returned the same way. Besides seeing the stratified badlands, we spotted petrified wood and prickly pear cactus. Formations we saw included piping and caprocks.</p>

<p>For the Little Mo Nature Trail, we started by the Little Missouri River and a small stand of trees. After enjoying the river bank and listening to the breeze rustling the trees, we climbed steps set on the hill to get a better view. In the distance, we noticed a couple retaining pools. We then returned down back to the car and left the north unit of the park, with a quick stop to look at the Slump Block Pullout, which had been blocked earlier by construction.</p>

<p>We headed south until we reached Interstate Highway 94. Soon after entering the freeway, we exited it to get to the Painted Canyon Visitor Center of Theodore Roosevelt National Park. I enquired about the nature trail there, then we went outside to take it. We enjoyed the short hike up and down the badlands, with some great views, then returned to the car.</p>

<p>Further west on the interstate, we reached the Medora Visitor Center. We went in to check out the exhibits about the park and the person the park was named after, Theodore Roosevelt. A ranger there showed off a snake that he held. Before leaving, I took a look at an electronic information kiosk, which I discovered could access the internet. With no other visitors there late in the day, we took enough time to both check our e-mail.</p>

<p>Nearby, in the town of Medora, we headed for the campground to check in after picking a spot. We had enough time in the evening to do our laundry. Then, we had a simple, cooked dinner, showered and slept.</p>
