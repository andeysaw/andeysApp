<p>We packed up camp in Gouldings then headed north, crossing the San Juan River in Mexican Hat. North of town I turned right onto a dirt road to get a better look at the rock after which the town was named. Continuing on the paved road, I next took a side trip to Goosenecks State Park, where I could look down into the winding canyons caused by the meanders of the San Juan River.</p>

<p>Backtracking a little, I then turned left onto a dirt road leading into an area known as the Valley of the Gods. The scenery had similarities to Monument Valley, but to a lesser extent. I was surprised at the end to pass by a Bed and Breakfast. As I exited the valley, the road changed to gravel and started climbing with signs noting a speed of five miles per hour for curves. I was going up the Moki Dugway, which climbed one thousand feet in three miles. At the end, we stopped for a great view of the valley below.</p>

<p>Taking another side trip, I drove onto another dirt road, this one going to Muley Point Overlook in the Glen Canyon National Recreation Area. From the end there, I could see the canyons of the San Juan River one thousand feet higher than at Goosenecks State Park. Finally, we reached our destination for the day, Natural Bridges National Monument, stopping first at the visitor center. The campground there was small with only thirteen sites, so we quickly secured a camp.</p>

<p>Li-Li didn't want to hike in the heat of the afternoon, so we took the park scenic drive, stopping at the overlook of each of the three natural bridges in the park, Sipapi, Kachina and Owachomo Bridge. I then returned to camp to let Li-Li relax and read a book, while I returned to the visitor center, where I chatted on the phone with my friend Joy and then made conversation with the rangers. Also, I checked out the photovoltaic array nearby that provided most of the electricity to the park.</p>

<p>Early evening arrived as did increased cloud cover to cool the air, so Li-Li and I set out to hike the short trail that leaded us under Owachomo Bridge. It was pretty impressive in both its size and slender span. We then climbed back out of Armstrong Canyon and drove off to the trail to Sipapu Bridge, stopping by the visitor center to make sure no rain was in the forecast. There was none, so down we went into White Canyon, descending a ladder at one point, until we got to a good overlook of the bridge. After taking pictures there, we encountered a small ruin, then I parted with Li-Li to meet her later at Kachina Bridge. She returned to the car while I descended further into the canyon.</p>

<p>I looked at Sipapu Bridge straight up from underneath, then started walking down the canyon. It was a lovely walk with a stream occasionally showing up. However, there was also plenty of vegetation brushing up against my legs. I managed to get a few needles stuck to my ankle from a cactus plant, but that was the most discomfort I received. I almost missed spotting the ancient cliffside ruin known as Horsecollar Ruin.</p>

<p>It seemed to take a while, but finally Kachina Bridge appeared in the distance and I walked under its thick arch. Soon after that, I found the steep trail that climbed back to the parking lot, where I found Li-Li relaxing in my car. We returned to camp to relax and eat dinner. Darkness set in and we attended a slide show with a ranger talking about the geology of the park. After that, we slept.</p>
