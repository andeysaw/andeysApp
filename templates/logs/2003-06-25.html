<p>My brother and I woke up early and made it to Station Mall in plenty of time to catch the Agawa Canyon Tour Train. The train started slowly, making its way through town past the casino, paper mill and lumber mill. I noticed that, in my section of the train, the announcer told us about the sights a little bit after we passed them. However, we could find out about the places we passed in a booklet given to us, marking places by their mileage from Station Mall.</p>

<p>Soon, the sight of industry disappeared as we entered rural areas. Occasionally, I would see Highway 556 along with country homes. Views of lakes became more frequent. In the town of Searchmont, we got a welcome by the children of Searchmont School as they held up signs greeting us. The announcer told us that they would be missed, because this was the last day of school for them before summer break.</p>

<p>The train continued through the forest, passing more lakes. Sometimes, I would spot guest cabins used by outdoor recreationists. A couple times, I noticed evidence of lumbering operations. The most dramatic scenery came as we crossed on the trestle above the Montreal River. We had a great view of the river valley and a dam with its large generating station.</p>

<p>After hitting the highest point on the line, the train descended to Agawa Canyon Park, our destination at mile 114. My brother and I disembarked and headed for the more than 300 steps that led us to a great overall view of the canyon. The sky sprinkled on us a little as we headed back down, but not enough to bother us.</p>

<p>We figured we could visit all the waterfalls in the park in the limited time we had before the train left. Walking fast, we first stopped at the smallest one, Otter Creek Falls. Then, we made it to the more impressive North and South Black Beaver Falls. At the farthest southern trail end, we saw the tallest but driest one, Bridal Veil Falls. A trail along the river returned us to the train in a comfortable time before departure for Sault Ste. Marie.</p>

<p>Train employees had turned the seats around, so we had the same view going back. We got some sleep as well as took time to explore the train, which didn't take long. I also checked out the view from the windows on the other side of the aisle. When the train finally arrived at Station Mall, we got into our car and drove to the city visitor center. There, I found out I could get stamps at Station Mall, so I went back there to buy some and immediately used a couple to mail postcards.</p>

<p>I half-expected to get searched by US Customs because Canadian Customs searched us before, but we got through easily. However, the agent did wonder why I would visit Sault Ste. Marie all the way from California. Back in Michigan again, we drove south and then northeast until we reached the Lower Falls Campground of Tahquamenon Falls State Park. With it too dark to visit the park waterfalls, we just set up camp, cooked and showered, getting bitten by a few mosquitoes in the process. We then slept.</p>
