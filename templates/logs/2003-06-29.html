<p>My brother and I woke up, got ready and broke down camp, then drove to the main parking lot to start our hike around some of the waterfalls on the Gooseberry River. We reached the lower falls first. Heading downriver, I lost sight of my brother for a bit then found him at a bridge crossing the river. I decided to cross as well and we ended up at a great view of the middle falls. We then continued under the highway bridge to visit the upper falls. I admired the beautiful wildflowers as much as the waterfalls along the trail.</p>

<p>We left the park and drove north until we reached the parking lot for the Split Rock Lighthouse, but found the price and time to explore the place too much. Instead, we entered the Split Rock Lighthouse State Park next to it, where we walked around the shore until we found a good view of the lighthouse in the distance, high above a steep cliff. We left soon after and kept going north.</p>

<p>A taconite plant run by the Northshore Mining Company interrupted our scenic view of the area, with its massive gravel piles and smokestacks. After that, though, the beautiful scenery came back and we took a side road high up to Palisade Head. There, we stood on top of a dramatic cliff while enjoying views of the lake and other cliffs.</p>

<p>Further north in Tettegouche State Park, we got out of the car for a hike inland to High Falls. Then, we went back to the shore to get a good look at Shovel Point, a land mass descending gradually into the lake. Right by the view, I saw a small arch.</p>

<p>Continuing north, we made an easy stop by the road at Temperance River State Park. There, we found a river gorge. When we got closer we found a waterfall visible from a certain angle and clearly knew why it was named Hidden Falls. At the next park north, we made another easy stop, this time to see Cascade River Falls in Cascade River State Park. My brother pointed out to me that two people were in the water below the waterfall, wearing wetsuits.</p>

<p>As we kept going north, we saw less and less signs of development. We next stopped at Judge C.R. Magney State Park and took a mile hike through beautiful forest past Upper Falls until we reached Devil's Kettle Falls. After we looked closely at the waterfall, we noticed that about half of the water falling disappeared into a hole, taking a subterranean route to Lake Superior.</p>

<p>A break in seeing waterfalls came when we arrived at Grand Portage National Monument, where we found a partial reconstruction of a fur trading post of the North West Company. After entering, we explored the buildings. A guy tended the fire in the kitchen and, in the great hall, we saw rows of furs and other items of the fur trading days. My brother tried out a costume in the fashion of the voyageurs.</p>

<p>We found out about a guided tour of the grounds, so we went to the meeting place. It turned out that nobody else joined us, so we got a personal tour. The guide showed us the now empty grounds where many more buildings of the post had once existed. All the while, he talked about the voyageurs and seemed quite proud that they knew about the western lands well before Lewis and Clark's Corps of Discovery.</p>

<p>Just outside the grounds of the trading post, we stopped at the beginning of the 8.4 mile long Grand Portage trail, the main reason for the existance of the national monument. After that, we went to the grounds which held the annual Rendezvous, where he talked about the raucous celebrations that occured there. He also talked about the past and present lives of the local tribe, now known as the Grand Portage Band of Chippewa Indians, and waved to a couple of members he knew as they drove by in cars. Finally, we re-entered the trading post, where he told us about the end of Grand Portage as a fur trading center because of regulations imposed by the U.S. Government and gave us recommendations on places to visit on our way north.</p>

<p>Wanting to finish our exploration of the monument, we walked through a re-creation of an encampment outside the palisade, then checked out the Canoe Warehouse, where someone else gave a talk. We skipped the talk and walked up the trail on Mount Rose until we got to the first good viewpoint, then returned to the car. Driving north, we next stopped at the viewpoint of Lake Superior our guide had recommended seeing.</p>

<p>Within sight of the international border, we made a left turn and entered Grand Portage State Park. From the parking lot, we made a rather easy walk along the Pigeon River until we got to the dramatic view of High Falls, plunging down steep cliffs. It is known as Minnesota's tallest waterfall at 130 feet.</p>

<p>Leaving the park, we then headed into Canada without getting any more than questions from customs. Quickly after that, we stopped at an official visitor center to get maps and information about the area. Then, we went past Thunder Bay directly to Kakabeka Falls Provincial Park.</p>

<p>First, we set up camp at our reserved site. Then, we took the car to one of the overlooks of the magnificent Kakabeka Falls, 39 meters high and 71 meters wide. Realizing we had no laundry detergent, we went to the town of Kakabeka Falls to get that and more trip supplies. We returned to the campground to do laundry as well as cook dinner, then showered and slept.</p>
