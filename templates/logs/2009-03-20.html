<p>After work, I took my rolling carry on luggage and camera bag out of my car and walked over to the Radisson Hotel to catch their shuttle to the San Francisco International Airport. With plenty of time before my flight, I checked out all the exhibits in the International Terminal. First, I looked at items used in Victorian era kitchens, reading about how the industrial revolution changed cooking and serving. Then, I saw a large display of vintage toy trains up to the 1950s.</p>

<p>Finally, I saw some of the collection of civic art that was bought at San Francisco's Art Festivals from 1946 to 1986. It included some posters of the festivals. Also during this time, I called up my niece for her birthday. When done with the exhibits, I went through security using the new body scanners that require me to raise my arms. I also had to completely empty my pockets of everything, even a piece of tissue. For dinner, I just ate a small Caesar salad and mixed berry yogurt at the Firewood Cafe.</p>

<p>I watched the view from the cafe for a bit and then headed down to Gate A11 to wait. I called my mom and brother just to check up on them and then found an outlet to charge my cell phone. Not too long later, we boarded the plane and Flight 86 of Virgin Atlantic departed on time. I played with the Red Entertainment System, had some Cranapple drink and then eventually fell asleep to the music coming from the entertainment system.</p>
