<p>I arrived home from work a little after 5:30 PM and found Chris already waiting by the front. Arlene and Vern arrived next. When eveyone finished packing their stuff into my car, we headed out onto I-80, encountering only minor traffic. We made one stop for gas in Sparks before reaching the Super 8 Motel in Fallon and checked into two rooms. Chris and I took the first floor room because the second floor felt too hot. We slept not long afterwards.</p>
