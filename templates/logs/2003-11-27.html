<p>We got up to the cold morning and knew for sure that the temperature had gone below freezing when we saw the ice in a bottle of water Songyuan left outside overnight. We took down the tent and had breakfast when the ranger stopped by for us to pay our fees. Soon after that, we packed everything up and left for the park, heading north to Sedona.</p>

<p>I saw that visitor centers were closed for Thanksgiving. We stopped at one for Sedona and the one for the Coconino National Forest anyway, because I figured I could get information outside and I did. As we drove through town, we admired the wonderful backdrop of red cliffs. We headed to the eastern part of town and made a stop at the interesting sight of the Chapel of the Holy Cross, with the small building appearing as if partly buried in the red rock.</p>

<p>We left Sedona and headed north on a drive that took us on a winding road through Oak Creek Canyon. I looked carefully for a parking area 10.5 miles from the main town intersection and turned left into it when I reached it. After paying the parking fee at an attended booth, we got ready for the cold weather hike up the West Fork of Oak Creek.</p>

<p>Soon on our hike, we reached the ruins of Mayhew's Lodge, built in the 1920s and destroyed by fire in 1980. We also found a storage room there, set inside the cliff wall. Then, we passed into the Red Rock-Secret Mountain Wilderness as we continued on the path. A short time later, we had to cross the creek. From that point we never went far along the trail without making a crossing. At least each time, the creek had convenient rocks and logs to step on, though some provided only shaky footing.</p>

<p>The shady canyon with its high walls made for great scenery as we looked upwards. It also made the place quite cool. I first noticed ice when I saw some icicles hanging beautifully off a sloped edge. Then, I began noticing ice in parts of the creek. A couple times at the upper end of the hike, we found whole sections of the creek frozen.</p>

<p>Our planned hike ended at the point where the walls became so narrow that no dry path existed. We arrived in time to see the sun highlight the cliff above that narrow section and reflect in the creek. We spent a bit of time there, then headed back the way we came. This time I tried to count the number of times we crossed the creek. I lost count, but knew it stood somewhere around thirteen, not counting the bridge near the trailhead.</p>

<p>Back in the car, we headed north to higher elevations, passing Flagstaff. Taking advantage of the fact that we still had some good daylight, we turned off of US-89 and visited Sunset Crater National Monument. At the visitor center, Songyuan got his park passport book stamped, then we watched a brief video about the geology of the area. The ranger noted that the temperature was 31 degrees Fahrenheit.</p>

<p>Dressed appropriately for the freezing cold, we went outside and hiked the half mile trail that led us to the rim of Lenox Crater. From there, we got a view of the snow covered San Francisco Peaks and the inner rim of the volcanic crater. Then, we returned down the steep trail to the car, admiring views of Sunset Crater. We made one more stop in the park after that, just to check out the view from the Cinder Hills Overlook.</p>

<p>In the fading daylight, we passed through Wupatki National Monument on our way back to US-89, only stopping to quickly look at the ruins of Wupatki Pueblo next to the visitor center, already closed for the day. We had darkness for most of the rest of our drive. When we reached Lees Ferry in Glen Canyon National Recreation Area, we paid for camping using an automated kiosk, then found a campsite and set up our tent. We ate a simple dinner of soup with noodles, then slept.</p>
