<p>I got up early and grabbed an egg and cheese on a roll at the 54 Broadway Market, then walked over to Columbus Circle. I took pictures around there then ended up at Lincoln Center, where I encountered a long line of people hoping to buy tickets for the first concert of the season, featuring Yo-Yo Ma. I returned south though, passing Carnegie Hall and then looking into the lobby of the Lever House, a skyscraper, to see the art there.</p>

<p>I slowly walked down 5th Avenue, noticing many of the buildings along the way, especially the Helmsley and Met Life towers. Eventually, I found my way to Grand Central Station, where I got up on the staircases on each end of the main floor to watch and photograph the busy terminal. From there, I headed east along 42nd Street until I reached the United Nations. After clearing security, I signed up for the first tour of the day.</p>

<p>I looked at children's drawings from around the world and employees checking in as I waited for the tour guide. The guide first took us to a small model of the U.N. and gave us an overview about the organization. Then, we headed upstairs to see the different large meeting rooms with the General Assembly shown last. In between, we saw artworks symbolizing peace or consequences of war as well as gifts from various nations such as a royal barge model from Thailand.</p>

<p>A small museum on the second floor showed a statue and small items that got damaged by the atomic blast in Hiroshima. After the tour ended, I checked out an exhibit in the lobby of artstic bowls created by Palestinians and Israelis, then looked at memorials and a quiet room for contemplation. I then left, going west, and stepped into the Daily News building to look at a large globe and then the Chrysler building to see its stylized lobby as well as its exterior.</p>

<p>Next, I entered the New York Public Library, where I enjoyed expansive rooms with large, decorated ceilings. The place also had some historical paintings and documents on exhibit, notably the Gutenburg Bible. I wandered around the corridors for a while then exited and headed to the Rockefeller Center. I approached a kiosk to inquire about Top of the Rock when I heard an explosion and saw smoke. A cab had caught fire next to the NBC Rainbow Room entrance.</p>

<p>Unfortunely, the fire triggered an evacuation of 30 Rockefeller, so instead of going up it, I went down to Rock Center Cafe for a Fontina Burger and Pink Lemonade. I used my City Pass discount on the bill then headed to the re-opened Top of the Rock attraction. After a short wait in a room with a video playing and a model of the building, I and others took the elevator up, enjoying a little bit of an entertaining display on the elevator ceiling along the way.</p>

<p>At the top, I enjoyed a great though hazy view of the city. I particularly liked overlooking central park. I found I could take pictures between the clear plastic barriers surrounding the top. I also walked up to a higher viewing area to look around. At one point, I walked inside a room filled with colorful lights that responded to my movements. I bought postcards before leaving, then made it to the lobby to start a self-guided tour of art in the center.</p>

<p>Starting at the lobby, I looked up and around to see the impressive allegorical murals by Jos&eacute; Mar&iacute;a Sert. Instructed by a pamphlet, I then went outside to see the reliefs and sculptures such as the statue of Atlas in the public space and on the buildings, including Radio City Music Hall, before entering the International and former Eastern Airlines buildings to look at lobby art and design. Most art had allegorical meanings or came from classic mythology.</p>

<p>When done exploring the Rockefeller Center, I entered St. Patrick's Cathedral across the street. The huge interior had a somber tone. Along the sides of the pews lined cande-lit altars to various Catholic saints. I passed by each one and also sat down to admire the space as a whole. When I left, I proceeded north on 5th Avenue, noticing the shops and buildings. I ducked into the French Building briefly then the Trump Tower to see its indoor waterfall.</p>

<p>I ended up at the Apple Store but entered the FAO Schwartz store next door instead. The first floor had a large collection of plush animal toys and the second floor had big LEGO models as well as a walk-on piano like the one featured in the movie <em>Big.</em> An employee played it whenever no one else wanted to try it. Feeling thirsty, I bought a root beer at the food counter on the first floor before heading out to Grand Army Plaza to see the horse carriages.</p>

<p>I walked the southern border of Central Park, then headed south to Pat's apartment, wanting to drop off items before going to a Broadway show. Unfortunately, I could not get my copy of the key to work. I gave up and made my way to the Golden Theater. I got there too early, so I used the restroom at the nearby Marriott Marquis Hotel before returning. I then presented my discount ticket, found my seat on the first level, then waited for the show Avenue Q to start.</p>

<p>I don't have much of an interest in musical theater, but for the most part, I enjoyed the not-for-kids show featuring actors and puppets set outside a working class apartment building. The teenager sitting next to me seem bored at first then found the show funny. Afterwards, I walked back to Pat's place to find him still not home. Fortunately, I got my copy of the keys to work and let myself in. Pat arrived later and we chatted before I slept.</p>
