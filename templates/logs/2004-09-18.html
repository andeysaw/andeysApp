<p>I got ready for the day at my place, then took the BART train to the San Francisco International Airport. From there, I got a hotel courtesy shuttle that took me directly to Comfort Suites in South San Francisco, where my sister and her family stayed the last two nights. I discovered some people striking just outside, shouting and banging drums. I got to the room and ended up waiting a bit for everybody to get done, eating some of the leftover food they had.</p>

<p>For our first destination of the day, we went to Palo Alto, where my sister checked out the Stanford Shopping Center, an outdoor mall. After wandering around there for a while, we headed north, then east over the San Mateo Bridge and kept going until we hit Modesto. There, we visited the Vintage Faire Mall to meet up with one of my sister's friends and her daughter. We spent a long time there before finally getting back on the freeway and going south.</p>

<p>My sister drove while it remained light outside, then Billy got us through the Central Valley. I drove us into the county of Los Angeles, then San Bernardino. For dinner, we made a stop in Rancho Cucamonga to pick up food from Islands Restaurant. Then we finally made it to Riverside, where we ate some of our food, emptied the car and slept.</p>
