<p>I did not get quite as early a start as I had hoped, but got going quickly soon after Songyuan arrived at my place. He put his camping gear and supplies in my car and we spent the rest of our daylight hours driving south and east. On I-10, we encountered heavy traffic and heard reports of lane blockages, so took I-15 to CA-60 until it rejoined I-10. We arrived at Joshua Tree National Park just after sundown.</p>

<p>We picked a campsite at Cottonwood Campground and stepped outside the car to rather cold and windy weather. Songyuan could not effectively stake down his tent in the sandy soil, so we mostly held the tent in place with our gear. After a quick dinner of soup, we checked out a ranger evening program about nocturnal animals in the desert. The ranger, from Bristol, England, made the presentation cheerily, but could not help but mention the bitter chill. Well layered with clothes, we crawled into our sleeping bags afterwards and slept.</p>
