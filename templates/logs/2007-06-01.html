<p>I had a pretty good sleep despite the quick change in time zone. We took the morning leisurely as planned and went to the hotel's breakfast room to have our complimentary meal. I didn't like the eggs that much, but enjoyed the croissants and the fresh squeezed orange juice. We then got ready to leave and slowly made our way to Singelgracht across from the Holland Casino and Hard Rock Cafe to get our canal tour tickets from the Blue Boat Company using our &ldquo;I Amsterdam&rdquo; cards.</p>

<p>We had a beautiful day to enjoy the cruise down the canals. I went outside the glass cover to the back of the boat to enjoy the weather, while my parents stayed seated. Unfortunately, I could not hear any of the audio commentary in the back, so I just enjoyed the sights. We passed plenty of house boats and seventeenth century houses. I found the tower of Westerkerk particularly impressive as we passed near Ann Frank's House in the Jordaan Neighborhood. The boat headed out to the IJ where we got views of the busy harbor. It then headed back to the canals, first passing by the interesting modern architecture of the Muziekgebouw ann 't IJ.</p>

<p>The floating Sea Palace restaurant really stood out on our right as we entered the canal system again. We then passed the science center NEMO with its replica of the merchant ship VOC Amsterdam. After a close look at the ship, we continued south, passing the tower of Montelbaanstoren and the combination city hall and opera house known as the Stopera. We passed the Magere Bridge just in time to watch it open for another boat. Then, we returned to the dock where we had boarded and proceeded to walk south from there.</p>

<p>We passed by people playing with large chess pieces and continued to a tram stop, where we caught the next northbound tram. I got off at the Spui stop, but my parents and brother didn't make it out the doors in time and I had to catch them at the spot by Dam Square. Once there, I spotted the impressive Magna Plaza with the Royal Palace and Nieuwe Kerk next to it. I also saw a crowd gathered at the Dam, watching a soccer match, but didn't stop to look. We already planned to go this area the next day, so we did not linger and walked to the tram that would take us to Waterlooplein.</p>

<andeys-trip-pic class="left" data-trip-pic="magere"></andeys-trip-pic>

<p>From Waterlooplein, we made it to Hortus Botanicus. My parents felt hungry once there, so we all stopped first at the Orangery for food. I noticed that, on the menu, some items noted which farm each main ingredient came from. I ordered a goat brie sandwich and an apple pie, which both tasted pretty good. We next headed for the climate controlled greenhouse nearby. I saw a spiral staircase which I took along with my brother and dad to see the view from a raised walkway. My mom stayed below while we continued on the walkway to a room with high humidity.</p>

<p>The third room of the greenhouse felt dry and held desert plants. More of those plants plus annuals and pitcher plants grew just outside the greenhouse. We continued through the garden to the Palmhouse where small, enclosed table exhibits explained the concept of taxonomy in celebration of 300 years since the birth of Carl Linnaeus. Past that building, we found a rare Wollemi Pine surrounded by a protective gate. Back to the center of the gardens, we encountered a formal trimmed garden in the form of a semicircle.</p>

<andeys-trip-pic class="right" data-trip-pic="de-hort-flower"></andeys-trip-pic>

<p>By the semicircle stood three separate greenhouses with two open to the public. The Mexican Greenhouse had plants somewhat familiar to me, a Californian. I found the Butterfly House quite fun with its abundance of the winged insects. Near the door clung an Owl Butterfly with its prominent false eye designs on its wings. Flambeaus seemed the most common there. I made a quick stop at the Rock Garden and then the gift shop before we headed back out to the streets. We passed a sidewalk musician for whom my dad could not resist giving a tip.</p>

<p>We turned a corner and found the entrance to Gassan Diamonds, checking in to get a free tour. Our guide turned out to be Thai, so my parents enjoyed talking with her in Thai while I barely understood. Fortunately, she switched to English at our request. First, we visited a man polishing a diamond with machine. Near him stood a rotating display of the company's signature 121 facets diamond, sparkling beautifully. We then passed a quality inspector while heading to our guide's office. We sat down and she gave us a lesson in rating diamonds by carat, color, clarity and cut, showing us examples. I easily saw color differences, but had a harder time determining clarity.</p>

<p>After the tour, we stopped at the gift shop, where I used a coupon from the &ldquo;I Amsterdam&rdquo; book to get a free gift, which turned out to be a chocolate in the shape of a cut diamond. We took advantage of the complimentary beverages before leaving. I realized we still had plenty of time, so I took us to the Museum het Rembrandthuis. I passed right by the building, then turned back and found the small sign above the entrance. Our look of the place started a level below the entrance. We slowly made our way through each room then up sets of stairs to see many paintings and etchings by Rembrandt.</p>

<p>The house was furnished in seventeenth century decor, including a modest box bed. One room had art supplies the artist would have used. Another one had his collection of art objects and rarities. At the highest level accessible to the public, we found more art and a more modern set of stairs down. Along the way down was a room that showed art by Eugeen van Mieghem, featuring drawings of his wife Augustine as she suffered from tuberculosis. After that, I left to find my parents already waiting outside. We took a walk along the canal, passing a market and the Stopera.</p>

<andeys-trip-pic class="right" data-trip-pic="cactii-flowers"></andeys-trip-pic>

<p>We reached the Munttoren and took a stroll through the Bloemenmarkt to enjoy the large display of flowers for sale. The market had an extensive inventory of bulbs, seeds and full blooms, including little cactii, bamboo and the famous tulips. After that, we took a short tram ride to the Samo Seba restaurant to try Indonesian food. My brother and I shared a rijsttafel which consisted of seventeen small dishes. My dad tried some of it too. I enjoyed the combination and sometimes complimentary variety of tastes. We finished all the dishes without problems.</p>

<p>After dinner, we headed to the Van Gogh Museum, checking out the Friday night scene there. Inside, the lobby had couches where people enjoyed drinks from the bar and the ambient music put out by a DJ. A large projection of paintings by Max Beckman shown on the walls above, interposed with video from a camera pointed down at the lobby. Anything blue, like the floor, showed up as parts of the painting, giving the effect of people walking on it, defying gravity. My jacket, also blue, allowed me to look partially invisible on the projection. I imagined myself wearing an invisibility cloak.</p>

<p>I told my parents to go their own pace and leave when they got tired. They knew the way back to the our hotel close to there. My brother and I started on the ground floor, which featured artists that inspired Van Gogh such as Jean-Fran√ßois Millet. The first floor had some of Van Gogh's most famous paintings, such as Sunflowers and Wheatfield with Crows. I found out he also tried imitating Japanese woodcuts. My brother said the kanji characters he used made no sense. The second floor delved into studying Van Gogh's techniques and included a set of computers where one could learn more.</p>

<andeys-trip-pic class="left" data-trip-pic="rijsttafel"></andeys-trip-pic>

<p>Back in the lobby, we crossed the node into the newer exhibition wing to see the exhibit &ldquo;Max Beckmann in Amsterdam, 1937-1947.&rdquo; His extensive collection, inspiried by Van Gogh and others, was displayed over three floors. He appeared to have a theme of claustrophobia, yearning to escape. His triptychs of theatre and circus artists were accompanied by touch screens where you could delve into the meaning of the art pieces. The exhibit also showed his portrait work and some personal items.</p>

<p>A looping video by Gerbrand Burger, inspired by Beckmann, showed fully grown people hatching from an egg in an elevator then getting into a car only to thrown out later into a heap. Just before 21:00, we went to the second floor of the exhibition wing to watch a live Beckmann-inspired performance. A mime performer played a masked character with a demented laugh, responded to the notes from a tuba player. She then began coughing and changed to a vulnerable person after she removed her mask.</p>

<p>After the strange, short performance, my brother and I left the museum and got a couple toiletries at the nearby Albert Heijn Supermarket. Shortly after that, we returned to Hotel Fita. My brother chatted with his friends online and I planned for the next day. I also wrote postcards and then we went to sleep.</p>
