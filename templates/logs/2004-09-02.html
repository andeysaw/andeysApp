<p>My parents and Tippy left early for golf, leaving my brother and I alone in the house to eat breakfast. I looked at the four Chinese Shar Pei dogs in the back porch as they looked back at me. We left with the minivan for downtown Memphis, where we parked to visit the National Civil Rights Museum. The museum kept the front of the Lorraine Motel, which it was when Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. got assassinated there. A wreath and plaque marked the site.</p>

<p>Inside the first part of the museum, we read from wall panels with pictures and quotes. The story progressed through slavery, emancipation, reconstruction and segregation. It then got into great detail about the great struggle for desegregation. A bus exhibit had a recorded voice from the bus driver telling us to move to the back when we sat in the front. We sped up our look at the exhibits when we realized how much time we already took up.</p>

<p>Eventually, we got to the recreation of the motel room as it looked the day King died. We then went across the parking lot to the entrance of the second part of the museum, which concentrated on the case of the assassination, showing evidence and detailing timelines. It showed the room of the shooter and his view of the motel balcony. When done looking at the place inside, I went outside to take pictures and noticed a lone person boycotting the museum, but I didn't bother to find out more.</p>

<p>Back in the minivan, we went off to the house in Cordova to meet with my parents as planned. They then called us and told us to meet at Graceland, but to pick up their walking shoes at the house. We skipped a good lunch to do this yet ended up at Graceland before them. We finally met up near the ticket booths and got Plantinum tour tickets, letting us see every exhibit in the complex. First off, we boarded the bus to Graceland Mansion along with audio tour guide devices.</p>

<p>After we got let in the front door, we all went our own pace, pressing the buttons to play audio corresponding to the displays we saw. I passed through rooms of unusual design downstairs, such as the TV Room, Pool Room and Jungle Room, then found a room together displaying other furniture that the place has had during Elvis' stay. Exiting to the outside, I passed a car port and stable with horses before entering the Trophy Hall.</p>

<p>Going inside the building, I found a large collection of items from Elvis' career as a singer and actor, including gold and platinum records, movie posters and television broadcasts. It even had stuff from his time in the army. The next significant building I entered had once been the racquetball court. It now housed a massive collection of awards, gold and platinum records and several costumes worn in performances. A big screen above showed part of his <em>Aloha From Hawaii</em> broadcast.</p>

<p>The Graceland tour ended with a visit to the Mediation Garden, where Elvis Presley and some of his relatives were buried. Many tributes to the entertainer lay throughout the area from people around the world, some quite recent. While waiting for the bus to take us back to the museum, I got in shots of Graceland Mansion's front. After disembarking the bus, we headed for the nearest museum we saw, the Automobile Museum.</p>

<p>Basically, the Auto Museum showcased Elvis' car and motorcycle collection as well as a race car dedicated to him. One of the more famous cars displayed was his 1955 pink cadillac. The place also had a couple other vehicles, like a snowmobile converted for use on grass. Continuing on, we went inside the Sincerely Elvis museum, seeing display windows full of memorabilia. We waited for my dad to show up so we could see the film next and found he already checked out the airplanes.</p>

<p>Inside a small theater we saw the film <em>Walk a Mile in My Shoes,</em> which had clips from Elvis' moments on film, including some spontaneous humor. Finally, we minus my dad visited the two custom airplanes, one bigger than the other. The big one had some luxurious amenities such as gold plating in the lavatories. After that, we all got into the minivan and went back to the house in Cordova.</p>

<p>Tippy greeted us and, after a little rest, took us out back to downtown Memphis, where we went to Sawaddii Thai Cuisine to eat dinner, only about a block away from where we ate the day before. I noticed there and before that super friendly Tippy seemed to know a lot of people in town. Anyway, we planned to get an early start the next day, so after dinner we just went right back to the place in Cordova to sleep.</p>
