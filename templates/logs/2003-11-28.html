<p>We got up, broke down camp and had breakfast with hot chocolate, then drove down to the Colorado River for a good look at it. While there, we found the remains of the historic buildings at Lees Ferry, including a post office and fort. Also, we saw an old steam boiler and broken paddlewheel. I walked a little down the Spencer Trail until I found part of the wreck of the Charles H. Spencer steamboat sitting in the river.</p>

<p>Walking back, I enjoyed the view of the river with the Vermilion Cliffs in the background. We then drove out of the area, making a stop to look at two balanced rocks near the road. We crossed the Colorado River at Navajo Bridge, glimpsing Marble Canyon, then turned left to go north to Page. Briefly, we stopped at a scenic view point to look at the landscape below, with flat sections punctuated by steep-walled, narrow canyons. I noticed Navajos there setting up tables to sell stuff.</p>

<p>Just before we hit the town of Page, we made a turnoff left to a small dirt parking lot. We got out and walked a short trail that led up a sandy hill then down to the rim of Glen Canyon. I felt awed as soon as I peered over the rim to a wonderful view of a horseshoe bend in the Colorado River. We hung around there to take pictures, then walked back to the car, getting a view of Page along the way.</p>

<p>We next stopped at the Carl Hayden Visitor Center at Glen Canyon Dam. After making it through the security checkpoint, we entered the building and got a good look at the Glen Canyon Bridge and down the massive dam. Originally, Songyuan wanted to visit Upper Antelope Canyon afterwards, but after taking a look at the cloudy sky, decided to wait for a sunnier day someday. I did not mind because I had at least visited the lower canyon on a previous trip.</p>

<p>We decided to make more of our visit to the dam. Songyuan wanted to tour it, but we found that the noon tour had filled and did not want to wait for the next one two hours later, so we just checked out two of the films showing in the small theater, one about Glen Canyon itself and the other about the construction of the dam. Finally, we went outside to a windowless view of the dam, where we noticed one of the historic concrete pouring buckets below.</p>

<p>After a stop for fuel, we continued north into Utah on US-89. We drove for a while, then reached Kanab. Songyuan wanted to visit the office of the Bureau of Land Management there, so we made it a stop. He really wanted to visit The Wave and, when we found out they had walk-in permits available for the next day, we got them, even though we did not originally plan to do so.</p>

<p>Immediately, our afternoon plans changed, because we no longer headed to Zion National Park. We planned to camp close to The Wave. To fill in our time as we headed back east, we stopped at the Paria Movie Set. There, we found two fairly new buildings representing the Old West of old western films. Kids had fun as they ran around the set, going in and out of doors. I particularly found the surrounding landscape of colorful clay hills gorgeous.</p>

<p>Because our campground required taking a potentially rough road to reach it, we decided not to visit the ruins of the real town of Pahreah so that we could get to camp in daylight. We returned to the highway, then took the unsigned exit to House Rock Valley Road, passing the Wire Pass trailhead. When we saw a sign for the Stateline Trailhead, we turned right into the campground. We found out the campground sat directly on the stateline, with the walk-in sites in Arizona and the equestrian sites in Utah.</p>

<p>We picked a camp closest to the pit toilet and not far from the start of the Arizona Trail and set up our tent. From the looks of it, nobody else would be camping at this free campground for the night. We had dinner a little earlier than other days then took some time to relax. I could feel the weather getting quite cold, though, and gladly slipped into my sleeping bag for the rest of the night.</p>
