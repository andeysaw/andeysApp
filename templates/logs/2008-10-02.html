<p>Despite arriving in Lake Forest by car from Berkeley late the night before, I managed to wake up at 4:30 AM to prepare for the trip. Two hours later, we hit the road, making only a couple stops to change drivers before entering Arizona. After a couple more breaks, one for gas, we decided to eat lunch in Phoenix, exiting the highway when we spotted a strip mall at Happy Valley. We sat down to eat at L&amp;L Hawaiian BBQ, where I had the mini Hawaiian BBQ chicken.</p>

<p>After lunch, we drove north until we reached the southernmost visitor center for the Red Rock Country, getting our first good views of the red rocks. Inside, a ranger gave me recommendations for a short, scenic hike while the rest of the group looked at the exhibits. I picked a hike and then we drove north and then west on Verde Valley School Road, stopping once at someone's driveway for views before reaching the trailhead.</p>

<p>We found the Baldwin Trail across the road and began hiking and photographing the red rocks, especially a set of them known as Cathedral Rock. We walked though forest until we reached the Red Rock Crossing area of Oak Creek. Craig slid and swam into the water while Joey waded and Pui and I took photos. When done enjoying the area, I navigated us along the creek to the road, where we returned to the truck and then drove back to town.</p>

<p>We fueled up and then stopped at Bell Rock Vista just to enjoy the view of Bell Rock, Courthouse Butte and more. Next we saw the other side of Bell Rock at another scenic stop. We glimpsed a chapel embedded in rock and then made our way through road construction in Sedona's center to get to Airport Road with its tremendous high view of the town and its surroundings. Many people stood around to watch the mostly cloudy sunset.</p>

<p>Adjacent to the viewpoint stood the Sky Ranch Lodge, where we checked out the registration desk area and got information about the place before departing the area. We then drove north until we reached Manzanita campground, overshooting its obscured entrance road a little. We headed back south to it and then took the first available site, registered, ate dinner and then set up tents. Joey used his bivy sack. I managed to sleep early despite the highway noise and bright restroom light.</p>
