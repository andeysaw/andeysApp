<p>To make sure we could make a tour scheduled later in the day, we awoke at 5:30 AM and broke camp. We then headed south into Texas as the sun started showing. At a roadside picnic area, we stopped to admire the view of Guadalupe Peak and its neighboring mountains. We discovered an unkempt man sleeping under a shelter. He woke up to tell us about his mission to bike from Tucson to Washington, DC for a cause.</p>

<p>We stopped for fuel in El Paso, where I got some cash at an ATM. As we hit I-10, I pointed out the border with Mexico. We then entered New Mexico, where we fueled up in Deming. We stopped at the San Simon Rest Area as we entered Arizona and did not stop again until we reached Kartchner Caverns State Park. I picked up tour tickets right away, but we had some time before it, so we watched the film about the cavern's discovery and saw the museum exhibits.</p>

<p>For a late lunch, we ate at the park's Bat Cave Cafe. I had a sandwich. The tour group met outside behind the visitor center at tour time. After an orientation talk by the guide, we boarded a tram for a short ride uphill to the man-made cave entrance, passing the small, fenced in natural one along the way. Our group got misted to control dust as we passed through a couple of doors protecting the cave's warm, humid environment.</p>

<p>Tremendous effort went into keeping the cave as pristine as possible while allowing tours, the guide told us. Even the first explorers kept strictly on the trail they first created. We could clearly see it in the thick mud of the Rotunda Room. From there, we walked up to an area laden with beautiful, delicate cave formations such as long soda straws. We then entered the Throne Room to see impressive large formations set to a music and light show.</p>

<p>We exited through the same way we entered and took the tram back to the visitor center. Before leaving the park, we spent some time photographing the hummingbird garden, noticing flowers and a couple of crickets. In Benson, we got fuel and Pui and Craig bought food at A&amp;W. We made it to the Gilbert Ray Campground in Tucson Mountain Park by sunset, where we heard distant coyotes howling. We slept after eating dinner.</p>
