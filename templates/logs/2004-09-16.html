<p>After waking up and getting ready, we left the hotel for the Denny's Restaurant nearby to take advantage of a children eat free coupon. We then left Grants Pass and got on the interstate, exiting not too far later onto the Stagecoach Route that led us to the historic little town of Jacksonville. We enjoyed the warm, sunny weather missing from most of our trip as went around the small shops and minor sights like an old barber shop. We grabbed some ice cream and stopped at one more store before leaving.</p>

<p>We stopped in Medford to get fuel at Costco, then went on the interstate to head south. Without stopping, we drove through Ashland just to take a look at it, then crossed into California not long afterwards. During the long drive, I helped them look for a hotel in the San Francisco area. For lunch, we stopped at a grocery store in the town of Mount Shasta. When we finally reached Berkeley, they dropped me off at my place. I didn't originally expect to be there and had left my keys in Riverside, so had the manager let me in.</p>
