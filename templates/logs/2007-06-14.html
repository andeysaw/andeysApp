<p>Midnight passed and I continued looking at the food and ice sculptures at Le Grand Buffet. A sculpture of a pair of birds facing a vase drew the most crowds. I left after taking my fill of pictures and returned to the cabin to sleep. I set no wake up alarm because we would have one more full day at sea, traversing the North Sea towards Amsterdam. When I got up, I noticed the ship swaying more than usual, so I took a motion sickness pill.</p>

<p>My brother and I went for a casual breakfast up on deck 11 then I returned to the cabin to relax for a while. I later spent more of my time and energy at the gym, running on the treadmill. After showering, I attended a forum in the Celebrity Theater called Life at Sea. Captain Pagonis, hotel director Eric Bohus and food and beverage manager Gianni Dotti discussed ship operations then answered questions.</p>

<p>The three talked about the ship itself and how they ran it, feeling proud of the work of the many people in the crew. They also mentioned their debate over leaving on time or not from St. Petersburg, when a few buses ran late. They decided to wait and catch up by going fast and thus used much more fuel than the would have otherwise. Somebody brought up their dislike of the change in itinerary not too long before sailing and wondered why they had substituted Oslo, Norway for Klaipeda, Lithuania.</p>

<p>After the informative talk, I returned to deck 11 for lunch. Then, I just hung out with my brother and friends. Later, I began to pack my luggage, but then felt drowsy and had a long nap. I awoke in time for the final dinner at the Grand Restaurant. When I returned to the cabin, I saw my laundry bag returned and could finish packing. We all had to leave large bags outside for pickup. I slept when done.</p>
