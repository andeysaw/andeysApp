<p>I had not set my alarm because I knew today would be a full day at sea. Still, everybody got up in time for breakfast. My brother and I opted to eat at the Grand Restaurant while my parents went to the casual buffet on deck 11. When we got to the restaurant, we got seated by a great window view with a few retired people who were veterans to cruising with whom we chatted. I made my choices from the set menu and ordered something with salmon. We left soon after finishing.</p>

<p>My brother found out the location of his friend Stanley's stateroom, so we headed up there. I saw that he had a private veranda and went outside just to check out the view. We had looked at the day's schedule and decided to check out the fruit carving and sushi demo in the Crystal Room on deck 7. There, we found a small crowd watching one table with people carving fruit and another one with people preparing sushi. An MC shuffled between them, asking them questions about their craft. In the end, we all came up to the tables and admired the carvings while sampling sushi.</p>

<p>Hoping for more entertainment, we headed to Rendez-Vous Square on deck 6 to hear a lecture relating stores about famous artists. We did not listen for long and instead wandered around the art work being set up for a later auction. Soon after that, we went down to deck 4 to visit the Fun Factory. My brother went to visit Stanley's younger sister Jenny playing in the place set up for youth. We saw that they had video games and Guitar Hero.</p>

<p>For lunch, we went up to the casual buffet on deck 11, then went back down to the Cinema on deck 6 to see the showing of the movie <em>Firewall.</em> The staff there played the movie from a DVD. The movie was a decent way to kill time. We wandered the ship afterwards, going up to the basketball court that sat unused due to the cold, wet conditions. Soon, we returned to the comfort of our cabin, then I went out again to ask Customer Relations about my options for leaving the ship the next day as well as about changing currency.</p>

<p>At the bank counter, also in the Grand Foyer with Customer Relations, I exchanged some Euros for a mere 50 Danish kroner, enough, I hoped, for a couple stamps and postcards. Back in the cabin, my family and I had to get formally dressed for the evening dress code. We were supposed to stay formal for the rest of the night. At dinner in the Grand Restaurant, I again met my dad's jovial friend and his wife, though not dressed formally.</p>

<p>It was good to know nothing happens for not following the dress code. What would they do with non-compliant guests anyways, who payed so much for the cruise? They had a very good reason, regardless. Dad's friends had a flight routed through New York, but an uncovered terrorist plot there delayed his flight. The couple ended up making it to Amsterdam without their luggage and would have to pick it up the next day in Amsterdam.</p>

<p>Having had our fill of dinner and dessert, we explored a bit more of the ship. The Hemisphere Lounge on deck 12 had a good view off the bow as well as a big compass for us to see. Nearby there was the Teen Lounge, which stood very empty. Some of the furniture had a somewhat late 1970s style to it. Steven found a side room with mixing equipment, a video screen and disco lights, but could not make anything really work.</p>

<p>We returned to the Cinema, this time to watch the movie <em>The Producers.</em> I enjoyed the movie for the most part, but one audience member with a piercing laugh found it really funny. After the movie ended, I went to the Art Gallery just like the night before, this time to guess the value of a Rembrandt and receive yet another free, small lithograph. I had a late snack up on deck 11. Back in the cabin, we received details on the shore leave the next day. I did some planning and then slept after my parents returned.</p>
