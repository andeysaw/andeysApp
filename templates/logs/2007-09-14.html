<p>I caught a ride to San Francisco International Airport after work, getting there very early for my late night red-eye flight. I checked in with Virgin America without any lines, freeing me of my small rolling bag. I then browsed the minerals and gemstones exhibit and ate the chicken bowl dish at Osho. With plenty more time, I looked at the minerals and gemstones exhibit in more detail then checked out the exhibits on Mien dragon vests and Hmong fabrics.</p>

<p>I also studied a wall of tiles. Each one had a different, unique design. I took some photos then slowly headed to gate A6 to wait for my flight. While there, the flight captain Mike showed up to greet everyone. We then boarded the plane from back to front. I picked up earphones on the connecting ramp then found my seat in the cabin bathed in purplish light. I played with the Red Entertainment System the rest of the day, trying out music, movies and TV shows.</p>
