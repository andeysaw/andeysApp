<p>I got up earlier than any other day of the trip so I could catch an early Greyhound bus to Philadelphia. I ate a couple breakfast bars from Duane Reede Pharmacy then, with the assistance of station employees, found the waiting area for the 6 A.M. bus at the Port Authority Bus Terminal gate 69. I confirmed that I stood in the correct line as people arrived. We boarded the bus on schedule and headed out in the pre-dawn into New Jersey.</p>

<p>I watched the unimpressive landscape for a while then dozed off. I awoke as we crossed a bridge into Philadephia. From the bus terminal, I walked east to Independence National Historic Park, stopping at a small shop for a bagel with cream cheese. I got to the park visitor center a little before it opened, so I took photos of the historic surroundings. Upon opening, I obtained free timed tickets for attractions that required them.</p>

<p>I headed directly to the most popular timed attraction, Independence Hall. After passing through security, I waited for the tour. When the guide showed up, he let us into the side of Independence Hall for an introduction to the place. He then led us to the room where the signing of the Declaration of Independence took place. Next to that stood a colonial courtroom where the accused would have literally stood during a trial.</p>

<p>After the tour, I entered the West Wing to see an original draft of the U.S. Constitution and the Declaration of Independence as well as a sample of the Articles of Confederation. The dim room also had the inkwell used to sign the Declaration of Independence. I returned outside to photograph signs and statues on the grounds before leaving for a timed tour of the Todd and Bishop White Houses a couple blocks away.</p>

<p>After a little wait in not quite the right space, the ranger giving the house tours found me and took me to a colonial garden. A couple others gathered, then he let us into the Todd House. Inside, our group found cosy rooms furnished with simple Quaker furniture. The ranger talked about the middle class family there while showing us the rooms down and up stairs. Dolley of the Todd family later married James Madison before he served as president.</p>

<p>We headed out to the Bishop White House next. Inside, we saw the furnishings of an elite family of colonial times. The house had a big kitchen. The library on the second floor had lots of little books on shelves outlining the doors. Other items of interest included Bishop White's draped bed and a doll house. When the tour concluded, I walked over to the Second Bank of tne United States Portrait Gallery but found it temporarily closed due to a lack of elecrtricity.</p>

<p>I went through security again; this time for the Liberty Bell Center. I glanced at the exhibits as I headed directly for the cracked Liberty Bell for photographs and to beat the crowds. Then, I took time to look at the exhibits. I monitored the time and went through security again near Independence Hall to take the guided tour of Congress Hall. We saw where the early Congress met and the Senate and committees rooms upstairs.</p>

<p>Just outside the secure zone, I entered Old City Hall, which housed the Supreme Court in the early days. I continued on to the Carpenters' House, which had a model of the place as it looked under construction as well an interesting fireplace with the Carpenters' Company flag framed above it. The First Contiental Congress met here. The little Naval Museum nearby was closed, so I continued to the Visitor Center in Pemberton House for postcards.</p>

<p>Three small touch models of park buildings outside Independence Living History Center allowed people to feel the layout of the park. The Merchants' Center next door dedicated a corner of the lobby with displays about the park and the building's history. After a quick look, I bought a turkey hoagie from a food cart then consumed it in Franklin Court, which had life size frames showing the location of Benjamin Franklin's house.</p>

<p>An underground museum at Franklin Court displayed artifacts, information and interactive exhibits on Franklin. While photographing the airmonica invented by Franklin, I noticed my camera malfunctioning. It soon failed to close and gave a cryptic error message. At least I could view previous pictures on the SD card. I decided to quickly look at the rest of the museum then inquire with staff there about the nearest camera shop.</p>

<p>On my way out, I made sure to send postcards from the B. Free Post Office so my friends would get special postmarks. I found two Ritz Camera stores on Market Street but did not like my options there, so bought a couple disposable cameras at Rite Aid, thinking to get a good camera in New York. The security guard in the pharmacy expressed interest in the broken camera, so I sold it to him for $20 without the battery or any memory cards.</p>

<p>I returned to the Portrait Gallery to find it open with power on, so I took a look around at the few rooms of colonial era portraits. I then headed north to Christ Church to quickly look inside where founding fathers worshipped. I didn't take any photos with the disposable cameras and decided to return them at Rite Aid and buy a Canon Powershot SD1000 at the Ritz Camera in The Gallery at Market East because of my familiarity with Canon point-and-shoots.</p>

<p>I went to Reading Terminal Market, hoping to eat cheesesteak, but found those stalls closed, so I ate pastrami on rye and root beer from Hershel's East Side Deli. A short walk returned me to the Greyhound bus station where I started an anonymous survey I got from Greyhound. The bus left on time and made a stop at Mount Laurel. I tested my new camera during the ride. Back in New York, I took the subway to Pat's place to charge the camera battery and sleep.</p>
