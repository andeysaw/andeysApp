<p>We got up a little before sunrise to have an early start on our long drive back home. After breaking down camp and eating breakfast, we headed out of the Lake Mead area, going west through Henderson to I-15. I knew many vehicles would crowd the roads, but fortunately we had only a couple brief, slow points of traffic on our way to Barstow.</p>

<p>Our slowest drive came at Kramer Junction, where we crawled as we passed US-395. Soon after that, though, the speed really picked up. After a total drive of about ten hours, we reached Berkeley. There, Songyuan loaded his stuff into his car and drove off to his home. I unpacked my own car and finally got a chance to relax.</p>
