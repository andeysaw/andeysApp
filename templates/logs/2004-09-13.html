<p>Everybody got up and ready a little faster than on previous days and we made and ate breakfast. Liam burned his Easy Mac, though, and caused a persistent burning smell that we tried to air out. We headed out of the condo, making our way down to Bellingham. At Costco, we bought a case of water, then drove north to the Canadian border. The customs officer asked questions and found out my sister had pepper spray, so we got out and gave it to them. We had to go to immigration as well and the guy there, who seemed in a bad mood, decided not to let Billy in and therefore our whole group.</p>

<p>Billy felt quite upset. At least we had no problems with the more friendly United States Customs. We made a quick stop at the Peace Arch Factory Outlet and looked around a little bit. I then looked up a guide to see where else we might go for the day and decided on Squalicom Harbor. It took a while for me to find the way to get there, but after asking someone, we got there. It didn't look like it had much, so we just looked for a place to eat.</p>

<p>We ended up at Anthony's HomePort Restaurant and sat by a table with a great view of the harbor. I tried a four-course early dinner special for a good price and everybody liked their food too except Liam. With the main reason for the trip gone, we headed back to the condo to pack. During that time, I went to the Recreation Building again with the kids and we had some fun playing with echos in the racquetball court and dipping in the pool. Back at the condo, Ariana wrote an entry in the room's log, then eventually we slept.</p>
