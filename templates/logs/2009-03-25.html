<p>I ate oatmeal and a bar for breakfast and then made my way by bus and train to the Supreme Court. I waited in the short line for a while and talked to a couple of law students from Georgetown there as part of am assignment. I though I have to stand a long time, but officials gave us cards to hold our place in line. I took the break to go to the cafe below the court to slowly consume a cup of hot chocolate. I returned to the line just before the big doors opened and put my stuff in a coin locker.</p>

<p>I got a seat in the very back of the chamber with a good view of the bench and watched many people shuffle in. After a formal introduction of the justices, Justice Scalia started with a decision on Puckett vs United States. Justice Roberts next approved admissions of lawyers into the Supreme Court Bar. I then heard two sides of an argument of United States vs Denedo about using civillian courts instead of military for a former serviceman.</p>

<p>Each justice asked questions except for Justice Thomas, who looked bored. After the arguments got formally submitted with the bang of a gavel, we filed out. I returned to the basement to look at the portraits and sculptures of justices as well as the beautiful marble spiral staircase. I then went back upstairs and took a picture of the chamber and elaborate hallway before leaving through the colonnaded front.</p>

<p>I met with Isaiah for the second time and we headed from his office to nearby Bistro Italiano for lunch. Afterwards, he invited me along for errands while he pointed out places of interest like the school for Senate pages. We soon entered the Naval Lodge, where he showed me the rooms used by his Masonic Lodge. The meeting room had an Egyptian motif but the informal room had portraits and cabinets of archives and artifacts such as a Masonic brick that once was part of the White House.</p>

<p>We next stopped at the Bank of Washington with its impressive chandelier so that Isaiah could get some Masonic business done there. He then led me to the Capitol South Metro Station where I parted with him and took a train to Gallery Place, where I continued on foot to the International Spy Museum. After admission, I got onto the elevator and chose a cover to start a self-guided tour.</p>

<p>The first area taught about spycraft with short films and interactive exhibits. Display cases scattered about showed equipment used historically in spying. For fun, one display had a James Bond car automatically showing it's gadgetry. The second part of the museum focused on the long, interesting history of espionage with props for visual impact. I had to speed up a little near the end as closing time neared. I briefly browsed the store.</p>

<p>Because of its late closing time and proximity, I headed next to the National Portrait Gallery, going to the top floor first and winding my way down, notably visiting the presidential portrait gallery and noting portraits and sculptures of many other prominent figures. New works included the Obama hope poster and Laura Bush portrait. I didn't finish going through everything but would return.</p>

<p>Dialing a Citibank locator, I found a local ATM for cash and then walked through Chinatown with its arch and Verizon Center to a Peruvian restaurant called Nando's, where I got peri-peri chicken with roasted butternut squash and grilled corn, trying out the variety of sauces for the chicken. Afterwards, I took the trains and bus back to Aspen Hill to shower, write some postcards and sleep.</p>
