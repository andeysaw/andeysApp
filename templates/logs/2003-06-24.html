<p>After waking up, my brother and I quickly broke down camp, got ready and headed to the dock in Mackinaw City for Shepler's Ferry. I wanted to make the first boat out, but just missed it. That gave me time to check what I was bringing and found I needed a new roll of film. Within fifteen minutes, we boarded another boat and headed for the Mackinac Island.</p>

<p>As soon as we landed on the island, we headed east along the south shore, enjoying the fairly quiet streets and beautiful buildings of the town. The town ended and Mackinac Island State Park began when we started walking along the east shore. Soon, we reached steps that took us up the hillside to Arch Rock and a great view of Lake Huron.</p>

<p>Continuing higher, we then searched for a big rock known as Sugar Loaf and found it after looking at our map a few times. Walking the paths, we next found the remains of Fort Holmes, situated on the highest point on the island. I had a good view south, but trees blocked views in other directions.</p>

<p>After descending west on the short Henry Trail, we came upon a cemetary, then headed south past the fenced off opening of Skull Cave until we arrived at Fort Mackinac. We entered and explored the exhibits about fort history in the buildings, including one with an animatronic figure looking out a peep hole and exclaiming that the fort was being attacked, recreating a possible scene at the opening of the War of 1812. After leaving that slightly amusing display, we noticed a rifle firing demonstration in the parade ground below. They appeared to aim right at us and fire. Good thing they didn't use bullets. A demonstration of military fife and drum music soon followed.</p>

<p>We continued exploring the fort grounds and took in some views of downtown, looking over the walls. On the second floor of the Soldier's Barracks, we went through an exhibit about the history of Mackinac Island. Later, as we entered the jail, my brother noticed somebody inside the cell. We found out why soon, when someone came to fetch the &ldquo;prisoner&rdquo; for the re-enactment of a court-martial, which we only watched briefly before leaving the fort. We ate the lunch we brought on a bench midway down the exit stairs.</p>

<p>At the foot of the fort, we visited an exhibit about the first religious mission on the island, housed inside a replica of a traditional Native American dwelling. Then, we checked out the eighteenth century French-Canadian architecture of the McGulpin House. The American Fur Company Store had trade goods of that century and a museum in another room that had selectable videos about Dr. Beaumont and his groundbreaking studies about the digestive system in 1822, when he studied a French-Canadian voyageur that had a bullet wound in his stomach.</p>

<p>Walking east, we looked for the historic Mission Church and noticed much larger crowds on the streets than our first time in that area in the morning. We walked into the first beautiful church we saw and found out we entered a relatively modern church. We looked inside a little, then continued until we got to the historic church, which we found mostly empty inside.</p>

<p>For our last historic stop, we visited the Biddle House, which had historic interpreters in period costume. When we entered the kitchen, we found a couple of them eating while another worked at the stove. It felt like we walked into a private meal set in the nineteenth century, even though we did not. Next door, we talked to a young woman in the Benjamin Blackmith Shop, doing some metalwork.</p>

<p>On our way back to the ferry, we stopped by the shore of Lake Huron then ducked into a fudge shop quickly out of curiosity, just to check the prices. We rode the ferry, then got into our car to drive to Historic Mill Creek. After looking at the small set of exhibits, we checked out the mill then took a loop hike that had an abandoned beaver dam at the far end. On our drive out of Mackinaw City, we made a final stop at the lighthouse, which had a great view behind it of the Mackinaw Bridge.</p>

<p>After paying the toll and crossing the bridge, we entered the Upper Peninsula of Michigan and continued north until we hit Sault Ste. Marie. We didn't make it to the final Soo Locks boat tour of the day, so instead we headed for Locks Park, where we had a great view of the tour boat in the MacArthur Lock as water it floated on rose to the level of Lake Superior. In the museum of the park, we found out more about the locks and their history. Then, on the way out of town, we made a quick stop to look up at the 210 foot Tower of History, with its three rectangular columns.</p>

<p>For our first crossing into Canada on this trip, we got subjected to a search by customs, but at least it didn't take long. We then entered Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario, and headed for Station Mall to pick up train tickets from Algoma Central Railway for the next day. Next, we stopped at Bell's Point Beach Campground to get a campsite. We faced a bit of a challenge as we set up the tent in a pretty strong wind, but at least we had a site with a great view of the St. Mary's River and some houses on the other side in Michigan.</p>

<p>Because we started running short on groceries, we got some at A&amp;P, then went downtown for dinner at Muio's. I had the local whitefish and got quite full from finishing the dish. We returned to our campsite after that to find that the wind had died down, allowing a few mosquitoes to show up. We showered then slept.</p>
