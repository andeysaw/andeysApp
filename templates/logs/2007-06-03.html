<p>After waking up, I finished up the rest of my packing and went to the breakfast room with my family for a leisurely meal. While waiting afterwards for my parents to finish packing, I relaxed and flipped through the cable television channels, especially looking for anything that did not make sense to me. I found a strange cartoon called <em>Lazy Town,</em> but my brother looked it up and found it to exist in the states as well. When we were all ready to go, we put the luggage in a safe place outside the rooms and checked out. We would return to the hotel after lunch.</p>

<p>In the meantime, I led my family to Vondelpark, starting at the statue of the Maid of Amsterdam on the northern end of the park. We took a leisurely walk on the path while looking around and watching out for bicycles. We passed the Nederlands Filmmuseum and a quiet waterway where ducks and ducklings swam. I led them slightly out of the park, at the suggestion of my Frommer's guide book, to look at the outside of the Hollandsche Manege, a Dutch riding school, and the Vondelkerk with its spires.</p>

<p>Back in the park, we crossed over a foot bridge, passed by a gazebo on an island blocked by a menacing gate and walked by an open theater with people setting up for an event. During the rest of our walk south, we passed a couple pieces of public art then arrived at the busy cafe on the park edge. From there, we walked out to the street until we found a tram stop. We got on the short ride without a problem despite my dad missing his 72 hour tram ticket. We did not need them after this anyway.</p>

<p>We ate lunch at Pasta di Mamma on P.C. Hooftstraat close to our hotel. I had lasagna though had wanted to try a panini, but did not want to risk the time it took to wait in line because we had a taxi scheduled to pick us up from the hotel. My dad, though, ended up taking his time picking from the selection behind the counter. We managed to finish in time still and returned to the hotel to take our luggage from storage and wait. The taxi came a bit earlier than scheduled, but we were ready to go. It did not take long to drive to the Passenger Terminal Amsterdam.</p>

<p>I had my Xpress Pass handy, but the rest of my family had printed the wrong pages from the online check in. Still, they confirmed our identities with our passports and we had no problems checking in and giving them our large pieces of luggage. After a quick pass through security, we walked the gangway. Just as we boarded, we got our photos taken and each received cabin cards for use as a key and for purchases aboard ship. We went down to our room midship on the Continental Deck to drop off some of our stuff.</p>

<p>Our room had two twin beds with hideaway twin beds above each of them. Of course my brother and I would take the upper beds. I found ladders for them in the closet. The portal was bigger than I expected for a low end cabin, giving us an ample though slightly scratchy view of Amsterdam outside. I watched as tour boats on the IJ passed close by. Our larger luggage soon arrived and we figured out a plan to divide the closet and drawer spaces between us four. We found the safe behind the mirror and I set a secure enough code that all of us could remember.</p>

<p>In the closet we found our personal flotation devices, which we tried on in anticipation of the mandatory lifeboat drill. When we heard the general emergency alarm and announcement, we left the room and went up a couple decks to our designated muster station, the ship casino. While waiting, we chatted with other guests until we heard the instructions to head to the lifeboats. We stood around by the boats until the all clear was given, then returned to our cabins, though I took a few pictures before then.</p>

<p>I did not stay in our cabin long and soon went to the upper decks for the sail away party. Up there, people lined mostly the port side of the ship as it set sail. I was unprepared for the loud blasts of the horn as it started moving and quickly covered my ears. I visited both the bow, port side and starboard side to check the views as we left. Amsterdam had some interesting and colorful buildings on its waterfront. Those modern buildings gave way to an industrial landscape with storage tanks, mountains of coal, large wind turbines and barges.</p>

<p>I stopped by the cabin, then headed to The Grand Restaurant for the main seating for dinner. I shared an assigned table with my family and two of my parent's friends that also belong to the Thai Physicians Association of America. The waiter and bus boy for our trip introduced themselves and gave us the menu with a choice between a few items for each of the four courses. We each ordered and got served in an orderly manner, using the formally setup utensils from the outside set towards the inside. For dessert, our waiter Achmed presented the choices as well as the ma√Ætre d's special.</p>

<p>We had a table near the window on the starboard side. I saw some of the view of the passing shore until the curtains came down. At one point, I suspected we were passing through a lock, but I did not feel that I should leave dinner just to see the lock in action. After dinner, I explored the ship a bit. I went to the Welcome Aboard Presentation at the Celebrity Theater featuring an a capella quartet, but left after only a few minutes. Along with my brother Steven, we decided to pass the time in the exercise room. First, I had returned to the cabin for more appropriate workout clothes.</p>

<p>Each machine had a video screen with a choice of ship channels to watch while exercising. As I tried the exercise bike, I watched a bit of the videos without sound and also looked outside the windows facing the bow. I could pretend I was powering the ship with the pedals. We showered back in the cabin when done. I went up to the Art Gallery later to guess the value of a Picasso, getting a small, free lithograph painting. Soon after that, I got back to the cabin to get ready to sleep. I only fell asleep a bit after all the family returned.</p>
