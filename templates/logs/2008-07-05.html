<p>We all got up early and broke camp, leaving soon after packing and eating breakfast. We returned to the town of Ely to get fuel before heading north on back roads. First, we entered Long Valley, traveling a long, desolate stretch through the desert. The road became dirt by the time we entered a hilly area, where we encountered the sight of the open pit Bald Mountain Mine. From there, we descended to a valley at the eastern foot of the Ruby Mountains.</p>

<p>Eventually, we arrived at the Ruby Marshes and parked by the main dock to look around. I saw some birds flying around and people fishing from boats. We relaxed a little bit there and then returned to the car to take most of the Auto Tour as part of our drive north. Occasionally, I made brief stops to photograph the mountains or birds like a cormorant or great egret. At the end, we arrived at the Bressman Cabin, built by a homesteader in 1880.</p>

<p>The road became wide and paved and then dirt again when we turned west to go over Harrison Pass, going past some interesting rocky scenery along the way. The drive continued into unspectacular lands for a long while until we reached the town of Spring Creek. We decided to check out the campground at South Fork State Recreation Area because it offered showers but turned back when we found a sign warning of contaminated water.</p>

<p>Resigned to another day without showers, we headed to Lamoille Canyon. As soon as I entered it, I felt impressed by the scenery, but did not stop until reaching Thomas Canyon Campground in the hopes of securing a campsite. We got the last one on the C loop. It had almost no shade but sat right next to lovely Thomas Creek with high canyon walls towering around us. We registered, set up our tents and ate our lunches.</p>

<p>From the campground, we continued up the scenic canyon road, admiring the granite cliffs as impressive as those in Yosemite Valley. We saw a couple tall cascades of water and a beaver dam at one point. At the end of the road, we had a great view of Liberty Pass. We found out from others that the trail up there was too snowy, so we decided to go four miles out and back hike to Island Lake, starting from the same lot.</p>

<p>The trail started as a long series of switchbacks lined with a plethora of wildflowers as well as caterpillars and cocoons. It crossed a waterfall in a couple places and then topped out at Island Lake with its island and steep cliffs, one side laden with snow. I relaxed on a rock and took in the scenery, watching dogs play in the snow and waiting until everybody arrived. We then returned down as shadows overtook the trail.</p>

<p>We drove back to camp and, feeling a bit tired, I decided we should take a break and eat dinner even though we had some daylight left. With light still around after that, we walked leisurely around camp and then ended up checking out the beginning of the Thomas Canyon Trail out of curiosity, finding a waterfall there and some wildflowers. After enjoying the sunset, we relaxed at camp and then went to sleep early.</p>
