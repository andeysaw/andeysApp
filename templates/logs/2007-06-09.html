<p>Upon waking up, I looked out the cabin window and saw a band setting up at the port, ready to welcome us and our tips. After getting ready for the day, we headed to deck 11 for a buffet breakfast where I checked out the view of the industrial port. When time came for the tour, we left the ship then got in line to get through passport control, meanwhile listening to the band. It took very little time to obtain the cruise passenger visa card.</p>

<p>We boarded a tour bus and each received headphones to clearly hear one of our two tour guides. On our ride into the city, we passed several interesting, colorful buildings including the Mariinsky Theater and St. Isaac's Cathedral. Eventually, we reached the banks of the Neva River and the massive Winter Palace, home of the State Hermitage Museum. We entered through the group check-in then waited inside among sculptures for the tour start.</p>

<p>After an introduction to the museum, we headed up stairs to the first highly decorated room, full of baroque stylings surrounding windows and statues and topped with a painting on the ceiling. As we continued into other rooms, we saw plenty more extravagent decorations. Everybody seemed impressed. I found Raphael's Loggia particulary noteworthy, with its detailed art fully covering the ceiling and arches.</p>

<p>After seeing room after luxurious room of art, we headed downstairs and made our way to the Gold Room. There, a museum guide met our group to show us the collection of gold and other precious items. I half-listened to the guide while looking into all the display cases. When done with the special set of rooms, we returned upstairs to visit the Hermitage Theater, where we saw a stage curtain emblazoned with the double-headed eagle symbol.</p>

<p>When we left the theater, we returned downstairs and saw a few more rooms. We quickly passed through the Egyptian displays on our way out. The tour bus then picked us up and transported us back to the ship. My brother and I visited a media store at the dock, had a quick lunch then got ready for our next shore excursion. Our parents would not join us this time. The tour bus took a slightly different route this time as it made its way to the Russian Museum.</p>

<p>I spotted the colorful Church on Spilled Blood on the other side of the building before we entered the museum. We soon went up the granite stairs to start our tour of Russian art generally in chronological order, starting with icons. The rooms themselves had decorative flourishes, but not anything like the Hermitage. Our guide discussed selected works in each room except in the modern art section, where she gave us time to roam.</p>

<p>The tour bus took us a rather short distance to the Church of Our Savior on Spilled Blood, erected on the site of Tsar Alexander II's mortal wounding. I found the brightly colored Orthodox Christian church impressive at least in its visual impact. Our group soon entered and I found the interior equally fascinating. Mosaics covered every part of the wall. I looked straight up to see a saint's face for each church dome interior. A modest monument marked the spilled blood area.</p>

<p>Our tour continued outside, where we the guide explained about panels of inscribed text, one kept in poor shape as a reminder of war damage. Then we got led to souvenir stands, where I bought some postcards. After a little while, we boarded the tour bus for a return to the cruise ship. My brother and I had a quick, casual dinner on deck 11, then joined up with our parents to board another bus which took us to a boat on the Neva River.</p>

<p>To board our vessel, we had to pass through two others. Our family then sat down at a table that had caviar and three drinks in different-sized glasses. I tried but did not like the wine nor Vodka. The boat started off and I looked outside at the scenery. I soon went upstairs for better views. We passed the Peter and Paul Fortress, the modest Summer Palace, the Aurora Cruiser, a boat hosting a wedding party and the beautiful Smolny Monastery.</p>

<p>The boat then turned around and Russian performers came out to entertain. The two men dressed in Soviet military style and the two women dressed traditionally. They sang, danced and played small instruments. Later, they involved the audience. One women asked me up but I voluntered my brother so I could catch him on video and pictures. They danced in a circle and then my brother and the woman kneeled on pillows when he got kissed on the cheeks.</p>

<p>People tipped the performers upon leaving the boat after it docked. We crossed two other boats again then took the bus to the Academy of Fine Arts. The building had an Egyptian sphynx in front by the river and statues in the stairwell. We headed to the modest performance hall to hear the choral group Otkrovenie sing. They performed as a group then separately by gender, singing classics and then Russian folk songs.</p>

<p>When the concert ended, the tour bus took us to a retail establishment called Babushka, where we could have our fill of souvenirs. Many people bought matryoshka dolls. I went outside briefly and spotted some beautiful domes. Finally, the bus took us to back to the cruise ship. For such a picture heavy day, I made doubly sure I had my photos copied to my portable hard drive and Steven's laptop and had the camera battery charged. I then slept.</p>
