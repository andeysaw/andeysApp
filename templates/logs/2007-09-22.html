<p>I awoke with time to spare, so I headed to the Cosmic Diner to have two eggs overeasy while looking at autographed Broadway posters on the wall. Next, I stopped at the post offce to get more stamps for postcards. I then walked to the NYC and Company visitors center on 7 Avenue and 53 Street to wait for then board the free Bronx Trolley. The trolley made its way up through the Upper East Side to the Bronx. I disembarked at the New York Botanical Garden.</p>

<p>I took advantage of the free admission for Saturday mornings and did not bother to pay to see special gardens because I had enough to explore in the time I had. After the entrance area, I explored the gardens surrounding the Haupt Conservatory then entered the Mertz Library, which had an enclosed orchid display in the lobby and an exhibit on lichens and mosses on the third floor. Back outside, I passed Twin Lakes and hiked the Forest Trail through native trees.</p>

<p>I ended up on the Mitsubishi Wild Wetland Trail where I took a look at the marsh, then passed a picnic area and returned to the forest to check out a small waterfall on the Bronx River. I crossed the Hester Bridge but then had to take shelter under a tree as a shower erupted. It lasted quite a while, so I headed over to the Nolen Greenhouses for better cover. When the sky started clearing up, I went over to the Rockefeller Rose Garden to look at and photograph the wet roses.</p>

<p>I used the restroom in the former Snuff Mill then headed to the gate on Fordham Road only to find it locked, so I had to walk back to the Main Entrance to leave. I walked south for a while before reaching the Southern Boulevard Gate of the Bronx Zoo, where I bought the basic admission ticket and entered, passing flamingos and pheasants on my way to the Congo Gorilla Forest. I paid an additional fee to enter the special attraction.</p>

<p>In the first display, one gorilla kept coming up to the display window to hit it, doing a brief slap each time before retreating. I then went on to see other Congo exhibits. One had three monkeys grooming each other. Another had large gorillas lazily laying on different levels of a tree. At the end of the Congo exibit, a computer let me choose what conservation project my admission funded, so I voted to help out elephants.</p>

<p>I continued somewhat counter-clockwise around the zoo, watching giraffes eat, African wild dogs play fight and cheetas pace. I then paid for and boarded the Wild Asia Monorail. It crossed the Bronx River into an area of Asian mammals, including elephants and a rhinocerous pretty close below us. After the ride, I took a quick look at the steamy Jungle World then checked out the World of Darkness to search for the activity of nocturnal creatures such as bats.</p>

<p>Back in the light, I visited the polar bears then Tiger Mountain to see the tigers wandering. In the limited time I had left, I skipped one corner of the grounds to visit the Monkey House and Astor Court with its sea lions. Slowly heading to the exit, I also passed through the Aquatic Bird House, Sea Bird Aviary and the area with Birds of Prey. I peeked into the Zoo Center before exiting the Southern Boulevard Gate just as the park closed for the day.</p>

<p>I walked west for a while and passed Our Lady of Mount Carmel Church, an important church there, then reached Arthur Avenue in an area known as Bronx Little Italy. I decided to try Ann &amp; Tony's Restaurant, sitting at the bar to eat Spinach Ravioli with Bread, Olive Oil and Salad. I then took a long walk along Fordham Road, passing crowds and large stores until I reached the subway, which I took to Pat's place to sleep.</p>
