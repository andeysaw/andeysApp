<p>I started packing after waking up and still had free time, so I headed to Times Square to see it in daylight. I hopped on the subway there to go to Chelsea and ended up next to the Fashion Institute of Technology with its sculpture outside. From there, I walked to the four-level Antiques Showplace just to wander around. Outside across the street, I also checked out the weekly Antiques Market. I did not end up buying any antiques at all.</p>

<p>For breakfast, I ate two eggs on a roll and orange juice from the Sun Gourmet Deli that I happened to pass. Then, I entered the B&amp;H Photo Superstore to buy a Nikon D80 SLR camera. Despite being really crowded, the staff had an efficient system for handing customers and I got my order after a short wait in line. For some reason, they set up a table to give away pretzels. After my purchase, I used a coupon from Circle Line to get a free B&amp;H branded backpack.</p>

<p>The subway took me back to Pat's place, where I packed my new camera. Then, I rode the subway to the Upper East Side to see the Frick Collection during a pay-as-you-wish special. I paid one dollar and received an audio tour package that I started using when I entered the rooms impressively filled with classic paintings, sculptures and furniture. I walked through all the accessible rooms of the mansion, only playing the audio on particular items of interest.</p>

<p>Due to its close location to Pat's place and length, I decided to take the Radio City Music Hall Stage Door Tour. After a subway ride, I found the office and signed up with a discount I had. We gathered at the entrance, then entered into the large art deco lobby with its tall chandeliers. Our guide talked about the place then led us into the Music Hall, where we saw construction work on the stage, which meant we could not see a demo of the stage dynamics.</p>

<p>After visiting the places showgoers see, we then got led into the elevators then into the building corridors. We saw old show costumes, many framed photos and other momentos and visited Samyel &ldquo;Roxy&rdquo; Rothafel's apartment with original furniture. We also got to see the floor where the Rockettes practice. Then, we visited one of the Rockettes and took her picture after she spoke about her job. Finally, we returned to the lobby and used the fancy restrooms before finishing.</p>

<p>On my way back to Pat's place, I stopped at a street fair where I ate arepas and drank some lemonade. I then picked up my luggage from Pat's place. On my way to the subway, I saw a huge Richard Serra sculpture being transported away. Pat saw me off at the turnstile and I rode to Jamaica Station then the airport via Airtrain. I got checked in, then boarded later and departed after a long taxi. I bought fruits, cheese and crackers on the flight, then we arrived at SFO in time for me to take BART home and sleep.</p>
