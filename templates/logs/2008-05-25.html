<p>I woke up at 6 AM and soon everyone in the household got up. Linda, Rosa, other guests Nag and Duchy and even the dog Pooh-Bear would go with me. I ate cereal and then made sure I brought what I needed. We left in good time and Rosa drove us to Falmouth. We tried to park at the Palmer Avenue lot but found it full, so we parked at the Catumet lot and boarded a bus that took us on a long ride to the Steamship Authority ferry in Woods Hole.</p>

<p>I bought a ten ride ticket book for our group of five, and then boarded, finding a space on the top deck. The ferry traveled slowly, making the ride relaxing and giving us time to enjoy views of the coastal buildings such as lighthouses. When we arrived at Oak Bluffs, we got information at the visitor center and then briefly looked at the indoor carousel before going into the nearby neighborhood, where we delighted in seeing pastel colored gingerbread houses.</p>

<p>We strolled past the adorable houses back to Lake Street and came upon the start of a foot race. After, they ran off, a couple people felt hungry, so we shared some chicken tenders at a ribs place on Circuit Avenue. Ready to leave, we found the bus stop and eventually boarded the bus to Edgartown, enjoying views of a beach along the way. I obtained local information from the visitor center and then we began leisurely exploring the town.</p>

<p>Guided by a Frommers book, we viewed the exterior architecture of the historic buildings in the former major whaling port. Behind the Dr. Daniel Fisher House, a Greek Revival style mansion, we took a small break, relaxing on the lawn. Then, we resumed the tour, passing the Whaling and Federated churches on the way to the Martha's Vineyard Museum, where we saw more historic buildings and a Fresnel lens in a fenced area. Pooh-Bear could run free there.</p>

<p>Restaurants cannot have dogs inside, so we got our lunch from Quarterdeck at the harbor, which had an outdoor order counter. For myself, I got a fish sandwich with chowder. We headed back inland to eat at a small grassy park and then returned for ice cream, which we ate while enjoying the harbor view. I spent a little time looking for postcards. Then, from the upper section of the town wharf, we watched the Chappaquiddick Ferry make its short run.</p>

<p>After a quick stop to look at the Old Sculpin Gallery, we walked down North Water Street and then the visitor center to await the next bus going to Aquinnah. During the long bus ride, the driver acted a bit like a tour guide, mentioning John Belushi's grave and celebrities living on the island like Ted Danson. She also mentioned where to find nude beaches there. Eventually, we arrived at Aquinnah, which had a great view of sea cliffs and the Gay Head Lighthouse.</p>

<p>After enjoying the sight of the colorful cliffs, Rhode Island Sound and the Elizabeth Islands, we checked the few Wampanoag shops there and then just relaxed at a picnic table waiting for the next bus. After quite some time, the bus arrived and many crowded onto it, making the long ride to Vineyard Haven a bit uncomfortable. We ended up at the harbor where I saw a manta ray and we asked about dog-friendly restaurants in town.</p>

<p>First, we walked to the restaurant Net Result, but found it already closed for the day. Then, we found the Tropical Brazilian Buffet, where we got dinner priced by the pound and ate at outside tables. When done, we lined up for and boarded the ferry, enjoying the sunset as we approached the mainland. Upon reaching Woods Hole, we had to wait a bit until the bus to Catumet arrived. Other buses took people to other parking lots.</p>

<p>When we arrived at the Catumet parking lot, we found the car and drove back to Dorchester, stopping for fuel at a Gulf station along the way. At the house, we enjoyed cake and I had a chance to relax while Linda and Rosa went about washing and grooming Pooh-Bear. I thought about my plans for the next day and then took a shower and went to sleep in the living rooms once things calmed down for the night.</p>
