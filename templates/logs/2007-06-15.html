<p>We woke up early to eat breakfast and make sure we left none of our stuff behind. We then disembarked at the Passenger Terminal Amsterdam, where Dutch officials checked our passports. It did not take us long to find all the luggage we left for pickup the day before. It took us a little longer to get a taxi van and when we did, we had it drive to Hotel Fita, where we managed to check in early so we could travel lightly around the city.</p>

<p>We took a tram to a spot near EnergeticA, where we spotted an old windmill on our way to the technology museum. We arrived just before opening so had to wait a little. When we did enter, we found no other visitors and many of the lights were off. It felt spacious and eerie. We had to look for the switches and flip them on. We saw many old machines of all types, including switchboards, motors, televisions, refrigerators and stoves.</p>

<p>Among the electric machines stood interactive exhibits. Steven tried one where he matched a motor to its appliance. Upon completion, all the motors turned on. A heavy door at the east end of the set of open halls led us into a huge single room containing such things as electrical transformers, elevators, an escalator, a solar-powered car and gas street lamps. One side of the room had a second level for a higher view of things.</p>

<p>We continued into a relatively small room of gas powered devices then went upstairs into a room with small, interactive mechanical exhibits and a model train set. Having seen all the rooms, we left to eat dimsum at Nam Tin. My dad tipped a musician on the way there after asking me for help figuring out the Euro denominations. After the okay lunch, we passed by Waterlooplein Market and took a couple trams to Westerkerk.</p>

<p>My dad felt tired, so I had my parents relax inside the bright and airy church while my brother and I looked around. We left them in the church while we took the guided tour of the tower, first looking at the gears, bells and organ then going up for a great view of the city. I looked over many rooftops including that of the nearby Ann Frank House. We then returned to get our parents before taking a couple trams then walking to the Museum Van Loon.</p>

<p>The Van Loon house turned museum showcased the wealth of a successful Dutch merchant in the seventeenth century. We saw many rooms full of elegant furniture and paintings and noticed such features as concealed doors for servants and false doors for symmetry. An annual event that weekend known as Garden Days allowed us into the otherwise restricted gardens in the backyard, entering through the kitchen.</p>

<p>We spent a little time in the small garden looking at hedges and the surrounding architecture, then returned back to near Westerkerk to look at the three triangles at three height levels of the Homomonument and the street exhibit of a photo series named Call of the Wild, featuring great animal shots like macaques in a hot spring and an elephant swimming. I also noticed a small statue memorializing Ann Frank, whose house we then waited in line to visit.</p>

<p>Inside the house, we saw somber exhibits about the life in hiding of the Frank family and others. Cases displayed artifacts from their stay there. I thought that the window shades with imprints of the street scenes of the 1940s was a nice touch. We made our way up from the old warehouse to the hiding space, passing through a bookcase door. A passage from there took us to the more modern annex with a display of the original diary and its many translations.</p>

<p>We spent a little time with the interactive exhibits, including a group activity called Free2Choose, where the audience votes their opinions on controversial issues. From there, we left the building and walked over to the Pancake Bakery for dinner. I tried the Dutch pancake and found it very sweet and filling. We strolled through the Jordaan neighborhood on our way to the tram afterwards and then made it back to Hotel Fita to take a break.</p>

<p>My parents relaxed at the hotel while my brother and I took advantage of the remaining daylight to explore modern Amsterdam architecture. We took a tram to the Lloyd Hotel to look around there, then walked over to Borneo Island to see many of the unique stylish buildings such as the Whale Building and the Y-Tower. I especially liked the bright red, highly curvy pedestrian bridge connecting Borneo to Sporenburg. We continued through the neighborhood to Java Island.</p>

<p>As we walked the shoreline, we crossed many small, unique bridges known as Fools Bridges. Three spanned across each canal. We also enjoyed the odd-shaped buildings. At the west end of the island, we walked the bridge over the IJ and made it to Centraal Station by tram. I briefly familiarized myself with the station before boarding another tram that took my brother and I back to Hotel Fita. We slept soon after returning to our room.</p>
