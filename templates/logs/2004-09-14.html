<p>After getting up, everybody set on cleaning up the place and packing. Once we put everything in the car and checked the condo one last time, we made our way down the mountain highway. We headed south on the interstate until we reached Lynnwood, where we had reserved a room at Best Western. I stayed there with the kids, watching television, using the high speed internet and eating pizza from Pizza Hut. My sister went to Alderwood Mall with Billy.</p>

<p>My sister and Billy came back in the evening to relax and let me use the car to take the kids on a drive around Seattle. I went to the area near the Chittenden Locks then across a bridge into the Queen Anne neighborhood. We noticed good view of the Seattle Space Needle before we headed back onto the freeway. I took a longer way back to the hotel, using the Evergreen Point Floating Bridge across Lake Washington. My sister and Billy then went out again while I stayed with the kids. We all slept after they got back.</p>
