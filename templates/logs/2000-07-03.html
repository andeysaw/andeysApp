<p>After waking up and packing, we took a walk on the beach of Anastasia Island, enjoying the dunes. At one point, a flock of birds flew right above us, which I managed to capture on film. Soon after that, we left for St. Augustine.</p>

<p>We parked in a metered lot, then entered Castillo de San Marcos National Monument, crossing the drawbridge for the ravelin and the main fort. Once inside, we looked at the Guard Quarters, which had replicas of Spanish soldier garb and markings on the walls from soldiers practicing writing or drawing pictures of passing ships. Going clockwise from there, we saw various exhibits inside the rooms about the history of the fort. A corner casemate showed a room modified into two stories by the British when they occupied the fort from 1763-84.</p>

<p>Soon we were on our way up the courtyard stairs, checking out the view from the bastions. There were many cannons plus a good view of Matanzas Bay. On our way out of the fort, we checked out the ravelin, which was built to protect the fort entrance. Outside the walls, we walked the grounds, passing by a shot furnace used to heat up cannonballs so ships would catch on fire when hit.</p>

<p>Continuing onto the city itself, we bought tickets for the Old Jail, joining a tour already in progress. The guide, a retired sheriff, talked about life in the jail in the late nineteenth century. We saw a replica of the electric chair while the guide talked about common myths about electrocution perpetuated by movies. The prison block had the original cells plus a collection of equipment used there. Back outside, there was a gallows that used to hang people.</p>

<p>Our final stop in St. Augustine was the Oldest House, built in 1727 and also known as the Gonzalez-Alvarez House. Inside we signed up for a tour, then had to wait a little, using the time to look at exhibits showing the evolution of the house over time. The tour started with the first floor showing what the inside may have looked like when St. Augustine was a Spanish colony. The upstairs were added in Victorian times, and the furnishings up there reflected that.</p>

<p>When the tour ended, we took a look at the re-created kitchen outbuilding, built separate to reduce the risk of fire to the house. Then we returned to the museum, also taking time to look at the Museum of Florida's Army, covering the entire history up to modern times. Finally, we left the city and passed Jacksonville on the way to Georgia.</p>

<p>We stopped at the visitor center for information on what to see, then headed for the Golden Isles. First we tried to get to Jekyll Island, but were stopped by a toll collector saying there was a parking fee of three dollars to enter. I asked if I had to pay for just driving around and not parking and the guy said yes. It was too much to pay for the time we planned to spend there, so we turned around and went to St. Simons Island, where there was a relatively small toll.</p>

<p>Once on the island, we looked around for Fort Frederica National Monument and soon found it. The fee was waived because we came late in the day, so off we went to explore the ruins. Mainly the excavated foundations remained, covered in oyster shells. We read interpretive signs describing what was once there. Finally we reached the end and the remains of the fort guarding the town, then returned another way to stop at the remaining section of the barracks. On the other side of the park, we found a burying ground.</p>

<p>We next headed to the shore, stopping at a Piggly Wiggly for supplies. At the pier, we sat down and cooled off with the lovely sea breeze and view of the ocean and lighthouse. The Sunshine Festival was coming to an end and we walked by the booths as we returned to our car.</p>

<p>On our way again, we continued north until we reached the Savannah area. We decided to camp at an RV Park in Fleming, where we got a spot on the grass next to someone's RV. This was one of the better RV Parks on the trip and had a convenience store and gas station in front where we bought more shower supplies. We slept pretty well.</p>
