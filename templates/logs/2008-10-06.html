<p>Unlike other mornings of the trip, we had a relatively leisurely one, getting up after sunrise. When returning from the bathroom towards our campsite, I spotted Javelinas in the distance. I ran to grab my camera, surprising Pui in the process, and got in some photographs, including when two of the animals got rather friendly with each other. When the critters left, we ate breakfast, got ready for a day underground and then drove to Carlsbad Caverns.</p>

<p>I took care of admission with my America the Beautiful Pass and picked up tickets for a later guided tour. We then entered the huge Natural Entrance on a winding, paved path. I stopped many times to take photos with my camera on a tripod, rarely using flash. A park volunteer along the way pointed me to fossils on the wall and a small bat next to them. I made it to the Big Room first despite my slow pace, so I took a break and used the underground restroom.</p>

<p>I rejoined my friends to start the loop trail going around the Big Room, passing plenty of beautifully lighted speleothemes with names such as Rock of Ages. At the far end of the loop in an area known as Top of the Cross, I got a great view of the cavern. Otherwise, I noticed plenty of pretty alcoves highly decorated with small formations. We had split again, so met up as planned in the underground lunchroom, where I bought a bland ham and cheese sandwich to consume.</p>

<p>After eating, we took the elevator up to the visitor center and the bright sun to prepare for the guided tour of Kings Palace. We returned to the cavern by elevator to await our guide. A large group amassed and then followed the guide down to the entrance to Kings Palace while listenening to his dramatically told stories about early cave explorers. We then went through a series of large rooms with lovely formations highlighted in places, stopping briefly in each one.</p>

<p>Pui and Craig already felt hungry when we returned to the surface, so they went to the visitor center's cafe to eat a local plate of chicken tacos. They recommended the dish, so Joey and I got it too. With time to spare before the bat flight, we watched a DVD film on Caves of the National Parks that turned out only to focus on Mammoth Cave, Hawaii Volcanoes and Carlsbad Caverns and the research done at each location.</p>

<p>The visitor center closed for the day, so we and many others walked over to the Bat Flight Amphitheater next to the Natural Entrance. While awaiting the sunset flight, cave swallows entertained us with their fly arounds and a ranger spoke about the bats. He stopped when bats began emerging. Soon, thousands of them streamed out. We could hear the flapping wings and smelled a pungeant odor. We watched until the skies began darkening.</p>

<p>Back at camp in Whites City, I found the restrooms cleaner than before. Regardless, Pui and Craig still went to the motel to use its facilities. Meanwhile, Joey and I spotted javelinas and got out our cameras and flashes to take photographs. Later, we watched moths and a praying mantis crawl on our lantern and tried different lighting setups for photos. Craig took photos too upon returning. When done with picture taking, we all went off to sleep.</p>
