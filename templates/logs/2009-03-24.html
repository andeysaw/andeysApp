<p>I ate fig bars for a quick breakfast and then called the White House to make sure they did not cancel any tours last minute, which they fortunately did not do. I had to first head to Union Station to store my camera and phone at Tiburon Lockers while I toured the White House, because they did not allow bags or cameras of any kind. I then made my way by train and foot to the southeast gate to wait with others.</p>

<p>A woman in line with a fanny pack ended up throwing it away at security's request, with them watching her discard it. We got a briefing and National Park brochures and then got to enter, first stepping into the East Wing that contained many photographs, including recent ones of the Obama family. I slowly followed the predetermined path through the rooms, looking around at furniture, portraits and sculptures. Each room had different wallpaper and all had Secret Service acting as tour guides. Some stood quietly while others talked about the rooms they stood in.</p>

<p>I exited through the main entrance and then helped a couple from Oregon and their German exchange student make their way to the Metrorail. They had little idea of getting around. After they entered the station and bought passes, I returned to Union Station to pick up my camera and phone from Tiburon Lockers. I then took the train again to go to the Newseum, easily distinguished by its huge text of the First Amendment on its side.</p>

<p>Outside, a case displayed front pages of selected newspapers from around the world. After looking at the papers, I entered the place just after it opened, first going to the orientation film. I then checked out a piece of the Berlin Wall with guard tower and the nearby special exhibit about the FBI's famous cases and its press coverage. The exhibit included a replica of the modified car trunk used by the DC snipers and the real Unabomber cabin.</p>

<p>From the bottom floor, I went to the top and outside onto the terrace for a good view of Pennsylvania Avenue with a clear view of the US Capitol. Inside, I found an exhibit on the press coverage of the search for Abraham Lincoln's assasin and a comprehensive wall of newspaper front pages from around the world. Going down one floor led me to exhibits on the history of news reporting that also had a huge archive of historic papers from their start to the most recent presidential election.</p>

<p>The other side of a wall from the archives showed a huge screen that cycled through video presentations. In between videos it showed multiple screens of news channels. I passed a small exhibit with a car belonging to Don Bolles, a reporter that got killed by a car bomb while investigating organized crime. Then, I continued to the 9/11 exhibit with a piece of the communication tower from the World Trade Center as it's focus. A wall showed newspaper front pages from that day.</p>

<p>The exhibit also had a piece of the Pentagon and the broken equipment of a perished photographer. A short, moving film played nearby. After that sad bit I moved on to the more whimsical exhibit on presidential pets, including a place to vote for a pooch for Obama using coins. In the restroom nearby, I found humorous headlines on the wall. For a late lunch, I ate at the Food Section by Wolfgang Puck, a buffet, on the bottom floor.</p>

<p>I made sure to check out the Annenberg Theater for its 4-D experience that just meant moving seats and air going along with the film. The film illustrated the history of investigative journalism. I continued with the rest of the exhibits afterwards, reading about the five first amendment freedoms and issues surrounding them. The floor below had a map of press freedom levels around the world as well as a journalists memorial.</p>

<p>I only looked briefly at the displays about news through Internet, TV and radio and mainly walked through the museum store without pause. I stopped to try a couple interactive games quizzing me on journalism ethics and then watched kids try out being television reporters on stage. Finally, I checked out the display of Pulitzer Prize photographs and the story behind them before I left the museum.</p>

<p>On the way to the Metrorail, I took a look at the Navy Memorial Plaza with its Lone Sailor statue and bronze bas-reliefs of significant events. I then took the train to Dupont Circle and walked through Embassy Row, looking at national flags of different embassies and the occasional artwork such as a statue of Ghandi, before reaching the Thai Embassy Office of Student Affairs to meet up with Korn as planned.</p>

<p>Not yet ready, he told me to wait inside. I ended up playing table tennis with the boy of an employee. Korn came back to show me a place to store luggage if needed later and then drove me to Aspen Hill, picking up Kat along the way. Kate, already in the car, entertained us with singing as we drove through Rock Creek Park. After getting dropped off, I went to the nearby shopping center to eat at Jerry's Subs and Pizza and then returned to watch a little international TV, chat about Bechtel with Pong, shower and sleep.</p>
