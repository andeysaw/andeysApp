<p>I fell asleep sometime after I found nothing of much interest in the entertainment selection. Also, the video games option failed to work. I woke up in time for the second meal being served. At some point, I found out we were over Scotland, but I only saw clouds outside the window. Our plane landed on time at Schiphol Airport, where I noticed security agents openly displayed their rifles as they patrolled. The line for immigration was long, but moved quickly. I then found out at the baggage claim that the rest of my family brought quite a bit of luggage.</p>

<p>After customs, we headed across the airport to the Holland Tourist Information Office, where I got each of us an &ldquo;I Amsterdam&rdquo; card, good for 72 hours from first use on the trams, busses and many museums. I also got a 48 hour GVB ticket for use after the cruise returned to Amsterdam as well as a return trip booking on the Connexxion Hotel Shuttle. The shuttle arrived pretty quickly, but we had to wait a little until it was full. The driver dropped off all the other passengers first, then took us to Hotel Fita, where we checked in to two different rooms.</p>

<p>My parents took the larger room on the first floor, while my brother and I took a room on the negative first floor, which was just a bit below street level. We used the tiny lift for the luggage. It could fit two people, but they would feel quite cosy. On the negative first floor was a computer with complimentary internet access, but my brother set up a connection on his laptop to the wireless network with the help of instructions found in the room. We unpacked some of our luggage, put valuables in the room safe, then headed out.</p>

<p>Everybody was a bit hungry, so I decided to take them to the fish stall Van Altena. We walked around the Rijksmuseum along the way, looking up at the impressive neo-renaissance and neo-gothic building, closed for restoration at the time. I found the fish place closed, though, so we went to Cobra Caf&eacute; instead, also very close to the museum. I didn't recognize any of the food on the menu, but ordered a pastry that seemed decent. We kept lunch light because it was well past noon already. My dad used the toilet in that building afterwards and found that it cost some Euro cents, to his surprise.</p>

<p>Soon, we entered the Rijksmuseum's Phillips Wing to see &ldquo;The Masterpieces&rdquo; exhibit in the only part of the complex open during the restoration. Walking in, we encountered an impressive group portrait painting and a great model of a Dutch ship. Elsewhere, exhibits showed off Delftware and paintings of mostly people and ships. An impressive 17th-century dollhouse stood in one room. Stairs led us upstairs to more exhibits from the Golden Age. A small room after the gift shop showed various types of photographs taken by German soldiers in World War II when they had occupied the Netherlands.</p>

<p>I left the museum with just my brother. My parents had already returned to the hotel to rest. We walked through the Museumplein on the way to the hotel, taking a look at the exterior of the Van Gogh Museum and the Concertgebouw. A set of large letters that spelled out &ldquo;I Amsterdam&rdquo; sat next to a pool by the Cobra Caf&eacute;. My dad rejoined us to walk to Albert Cuypstraat for dinner while my mom stayed at the hotel. We picked a Surinamese-Chinese restaurant called Nieuw Albina. My dad especially liked the noodles he ordered.</p>

<p>We took the tram back to the Museumplein, where we stopped at the Albert Heijn Supermarket to get some food for my mom. It probably had been a better idea to pick up food from the restaurant instead, but we managed to get something. We returned to the hotel, but the sun still had not set and I wanted to look around a bit more, so my brother and I took a stroll down the shopping avenue known as P.C. Hofstraat. It had mostly fashion places, though, and all the stores were closed for the evening. Back again in our hotel room, we got ready for bed then slept without much hint of jet lag.</p>
