<p>With a good early start to the day, we got ready and packed up our camp, eating a quick breakfast as we drove off. Originally, I had wanted to take the high road to Taos, but Joy wanted to take the low road to avoid winding roads as much as possible. The low road turned out to be a scenic drive that roughly followed alongside the Rio Grande River.</p>

<p>Our first stop was in Ranchos de Taos, where we got out to walk around and admire the beautiful adobe San Francisco de Asis Church. After that, we headed for Taos Pueblo, a still active community that has been around for several centuries. We paid the $10 per person fee plus $10 for use of my camera, then starting wandering around.</p>

<p>There were many curio shops which we entered to peruse the arts and crafts made by the residents. Most of all, though, I enjoyed looking at the beautiful adobe structures, particularly Mission San Ger√≥nimo de Taos and the North Pueblo framed by Taos Mountain. Also, we checked out the ruins of the old Mission that was destroyed in 1680 and again in 1847. It was now entirely surrounded by a graveyard.</p>

<p>We left Taos Pueblo and headed north until we reached the Rio Grande Gorge Bridge. After parking the car, we took a walk on the bridge until we reached the middle of the span. From there, I looked straight down over the railing, 600 feet to the river. We then got into the car, drove over the bridge, then turned around to cross it again, back towards Taos.</p>

<p>Once we reached town, we decided to take a walk around Taos Plaza. There was some good crafts on display, but marked with prices higher than what we saw at Taos Pueblo, even at the store that claimed everything was half off. At one store, we bought some chilli sauce to spice up our food. Nearby, we found a chocolate shop that claimed it used to be a jail. Inside were indeed two cells, but they were now pleasantly furnished.</p>

<p>We got back on the road again, leaving eastward on US-64, which wound through the mountains. Because it was close to the road, I decided to make a quick stop at the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Angel Fire to take pictures. Continuing on, the scenic mountains gave way to ranch lands.</p>

<p>After what seemed like a long drive, we finally reached Capulin Volcano National Monument just about ten minutes before the entrance gate closed. At least we had time to take the two mile road to the top, where we looked at an expansive view of the area. Supposedly, one could see four states from there &mdash; New Mexico, Texas, Oklahoma and Colorado. We then took the short trail into the crater of the extinct cinder cone to see the plugged up vent.</p>

<p>Back down onto US-64, we headed eastward. By the time we hit Clayton, we were close to the borders of Texas and Oklahoma. Joy wanted to, on a whim, have us drive into Oklahoma just because both of us had not ever really been there. On the way, we passed through the Kiowa National Grasslands, which was, at least to us, not very distinguishable from the ranch lands. We stopped to take pictures of the sign welcoming us to Oklahoma, drove past it to a turn around area with a sign calling this area "No Man's Land," then went back to New Mexico.</p>

<p>Back in Clayton, we then headed to Clayton Lake State Park. I had originally planned to camp there, but the strong wind and exposed campsites made me change my mind. We still registered for day use and took the trail to the spillway to see the dinosaur footprints. They were definitely there, but not as impressive as I had hoped they would be. In most places it was hard to distinguish the prints from just bumps in the ground.</p>

<p>For camping, I decided to go with a place close to our next day's destination, so we took a very long drive through seemingly unchanging scenery of ranch lands. Darkness came, and we still were driving mostly straight roads in remote areas. Because of this unplanned night drive, we decided to just stop at Arby's in Las Vegas to eat a quick dinner. It was quite late when we got to San Jose, where we decided to camp, but it took us a little time to find the campground, because no lights were on. I woke the manager, registered and got the key to the bathrooms. We set up the tent, showered, then slept.</p>
