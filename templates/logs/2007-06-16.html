<p>After getting up and ready for the day, we ate the complimentary breakfast offered by our hotel, then caught a tram to Centraal Station. We kept our eyes out for each other while passing through the big crowds on the way to the ticket office. After a bit of a wait in line, we got our return-trip tickets and rushed over to the correct platform to catch the next train to Haarlem. It arrived soon and we took some seats on the second level.</p>

<p>I watched the cityscape turn into countryside then back to city during the short train ride. When we arrived at Haarlem, we left the station and walked south to Grote Markt where we looked at the various items offered by merchants such as flowers, baked goods and huge wheels of cheese. St. Bavokerk, with its impressive edifice, loomed large on one side while the city hall, an Apple Store and restaurants made up the rest of the buildings surrounding the market.</p>

<p>When we entered St. Bavokerk, we found a concert in progress using the massive 5068 pipe Christian M&uuml;ller organ once played by Mozart and H&auml;ndel. I listened while exploring the church, which had some ship models, old books on display and lovlely stained glass windows. I then sat down for a little while to listen to the organ reverberrating in the huge space before my family and I headed back outside. We took a leisurely walk south until we reached the Frans Hals Museum.</p>

<p>In the museum, we first checked out an exhibit on local history. I found the exhibit on Tulipmania particularly interesting, reading about the fast rise and even faster collapse of the tulip bulb market. From that area, we walked around mostly in order of room number, looking at Dutch paintings and decorative arts as well as an impressive large doll house. In the middle of the museum stood an open courtyard with a garden we briefly explored.</p>

<p>Feeling hungry, we walked over to De Haerlemsche Vlaamse to try some frites with topping. My brother and I went for the Dutch mayonaisse and my parents tried curry. We then sat down at Caf&eacute; Studio for a more substantial meal, opting to go inside despite the smoky smell because of the scattered showers happening outside. After filling up, we went to the office for Woltheus Cruises to buy tickets for a canal cruise.</p>

<p>The next cruise already filled, so we got the one for an hour later. In the meantime, my parents relaxed and my brother and I explored another museum. I was interested in seeing Teylers Museum but did not feel we had enough time to see it, so we checked out the modern Dutch impressionism art at De Hallen. I did not find any exhibits particularly interesting. We went through all of the three floors rather quickly, but at least it passed the time.</p>

<p>We returned to the dock to meet up with our parents and board the boat for the river cruise. Unfortunately, rain made it a bit challenging for me to take photos from the small uncovered section at the boat's stern. Still, I got photos of the most interesting sights, including the windmill known as Molen de Adriaan and the massive Cathedral of St. Bavo. We turned around at the cathedral and retraced our path, giving me a second chance at photos.</p>

<p>After the boat docked, we walked back to Haarlem Station then took the train back to Amsterdam. From Centraal Station, we caught a tram back to our hotel and relaxed. I used the free time to call my sister's family as well as a friend for his birthday. For dinner, we all went to Utrechstraat but found our restaurants of interest full, so walked a bit of a long way to Thai Corner. After the meal, we returned to the hotel to pack and then sleep.</p>
