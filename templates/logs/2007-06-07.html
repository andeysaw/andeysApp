<p>I looked out the cabin porthole soon after I awoke to see a stream of islands passing by, some with houses. Soon, my whole family got up and got ready for the shore excursion. First, though, we headed up to deck 11 for a casual breakfast at the buffet. From there, I got a good view of our approach to Stockholm, spread out over a few islands. I could mostly distinguish an amusement park and the old, compact buildings of Gamla Stan.</p>

<p>We went to the Celebrity Theatre to find our tour group. On stage, a couple of the crew called out tour names and people would pick up numbers for their tour. My brother and I got onto the same bus as my parents, unlike in Copenhagen, but Steven's friends ended up on different buses. Each bus doing the same tour visits the same places in a different sequence to reduce crowding. Each tour guide carries a big sign displaying a group number.</p>

<p>Our bus first drove up to Fj&auml;llgatan and let us off for a good view of the inner city and harbor, though a large ship below us filled the foreground view. When we got back on the bus, we had to deal with a minor traffic jam on the narrow streets involving a truck. During the wait, our tour guide touched on the history of the city. She pointed out spy mirrors on one of the house windows that allow people to look at the street discretely.</p>

<p>We drove through the rest of the S&Oslash;dermalm neighborhood, crossed a bridge and then stopped at Stadshuset, the city hall, with the tallest tower of the massive brick building topped with three crowns, the national emblem of Sweden. A smaller tower I saw had a crecent moon on top. We enjoyed the waterfront view and statuary, then our guide got us inside. We had to slap on round stickers with the word &ldquo;City Hall&rdquo; printed on them.</p>

<p>We passed through the entryway and entered a large indoor courtyard known as the Blue Room, once destined to be blue until the designer decided to keep the brick walls red. A broad, low-rising set of stairs ran along one side of the room leading to a balcony. Organ pipes obscured by a golden cover were on the roof corner above the balcony. The Nobel Prize banquet occurs here every year, hosted by the King of Sweden.</p>

<p>Our group climbed the stairs then entered the Golden Hall. It had golden mosaics covering almost every section of the wall. One end of the room had a large image of the Queen of Lake M&auml;laren with the western and eastern parts of the world paying tribute to her. In contrast to the walls, the ceiling consisted of evenly spaced planks like the bottom of a Viking boat. This room is the dance hall after dinner during the Nobel Prize banquet.</p>

<p>We returned to the balcony, then got led through a narrow hall to the gift shop, passing a display of tableware used in the Nobel Prize banquet. I bought a postcard then joined the group in the outer courtyard before boarding the bus. I found out my family visited a nearby Viking memorial while I had waited in the long line in the gift shop. I glimpsed it as the bus left. Our guide pointed out landmarks on our drive through Normalm, notably the fountain Sergels Torv.</p>

<p>We gradually reached the Vasa Museum and quickly entered the building. Inside, the seventeenth century warship Vasa dominated the enormous climate controlled room. A map we received showed seven levels of exibits surrounding the ship. After an introduction by the guide, my family and I headed to the top level for a overall view of the ship from above. We briefly looked at each exhibit as we descended, getting different viewing angles of Vasa.</p>

<p>I learned the story of the top-heavy Vasa's embarrasing capsizing at the beginning of its maiden voyage and then its recovery and restoration approximately three centuries later. One of the exhibits showed the original sails while another showed skeletons from the warship. The third level had a recreation of village buildings from 1628. We finished exploring barely in time to rejoin the tour group to board the bus.</p>

<p>The bus next took us to the city center for a period of free roaming. We got off at a modern shopping center. I led my parents south until we reached the restaurant Bakfickan, located behind the opera house. We all ordered traditional food known as husmanskost. First, we got to pick from a variety of breads offered by our waitress, then we had our main dish. On our way back to the bus, we saw teens crowded into big trucks celebrating graduation.</p>

<p>For our final stop, we visited the old town known as Gamla Stan. We first toured the interior of the church Storkyrkan with our guide, viewing notable art such as a wooden statue of Saint George and the Dragon and the oldest known image of the city. When we exited the church, we went to the public square known as Stortorget, which has the Nobel Museum on one side. The guide gave us time to roam, so my parents rested while my brother and I wandered around.</p>

<p>We happened to run into Steven's friend Stanley and chatted for a little while, then continued to the Royal Palace, where we saw sailors and someone interview a military guy. More wandering got us to the Slottsbacken Obelisk and past many stores. We met our group at the designated time at Stortorget, then we continued our tour to a small courtyard with a very small statue. Touching it meant one pledged to return to Stockholm someday, said the guide.</p>

<p>Our group returned to the bus and we headed back to the ship, passing a couple interesting sights like the restaurant Gondolen, sitting eleven stories above the street, secured to a building on one side and a tower on the other. Once boarded, we returned to the cabin briefly before going on deck to admire the scenery as we left the port. Steven's friends Lynna and Alisa enjoyed the sun on deck while other passengers swam in the pool.</p>

<p>Dinner time came around and we headed to the Grand Restaurant for another good four course meal. Afterwards, I tried to get into my cabin, but the card failed to register. For some reason, it became demagnetized. All I had to do was get it replaced at the Customer Relations desk. I took care of that then went to the Art Gallery to guess the Miro painting price and chat with the people there, especially with Jina.</p>

<p>I returned to the top decks to enjoy the view of the many small islands passing by. Some had sets of wooden houses surrounded by trees. Most had a dock. The islands became smaller as we reached the Baltic Sea and soon became just small, rocky mounds. At that point, I checked the Teen Lounge, where I figured my brother and Alisa would be. Indeed, I saw them there, watching some anime they brought after figuring out the hookup to the TV from his computer.</p>

<p>I did not stick around, returning to the cabin. I found the port information and events calendar for the next day and researched what to do in Helsinki before our guided tour. I then met up with the TPAA youth crowd up at the Island Caf&eacute;. Brie was the only one not related to TPAA, but found the group because of her interest in anime. Later, we all stopped by her cabin where she showed her collection. After that, I went ahead and retired in my cabin for the day.</p>
