<p>My brother and I woke up early so we could have breakfast with his friends Eric and Alisa and her parents. We met at the Sazerac Bar and Grill, but ended up going outside. Alisa's parents wanted to eat at McDonalds, but we did not, instead opting for a small bakery. I wanted to try a beignet there, but they had none left. In the end, none of us ended up eating breakfast together and unceremoniously parted separate ways.</p>

<p>Back at the hotel, my mom called to invite us to breakfast at the Sazerac, so we did. My dad had already gone for the day to golf. At the buffet, I got to try beignets and found them to be a bit more sweet than I preferred. Overall, the place had standard breakfast food that tasted decent, but it was not worth the price the hotel charged for it. I later found out the total price for us three was around fifty dollars.</p>

<p>Steven packed and we got his stuff in the minivan to take him to the airport. He would fly to Chicago, then Japan to be an exchange student. We had extra time, though, so we stopped at Chalmette Battlefield, site of a short battle, but significant victory against the British at the end of the War of 1812. The interpretive panels along the loop drive detailed the events, pointing to where action took place.</p>

<p>We made a stop at the visitor center and my brother and I took the steps to the top of the Chalmette Memorial. Then, we walked over to the Malus-Beauregard House, built in 1833. It lacked any furnishings, so had little of interest inside. We also took a brief look at Chalmette National Cemetery before leaving. We made it to the Louis Armstrong New Orleans International Airport in time and said our goodbyes to Steven.</p>

<p>When we got back to the hotel, my mom went up to the room to rest. I walked a couple of blocks to catch the historic St. Charles Streetcar, which took me to the Garden District. Using a AAA tour book, I took the suggested self-guided walk through the elegant nineteenth century neighborhood, reading about each house mentioned as I passed it. The streets seemed rather quiet and empty on this hot, humid day and I mainly saw only other touring people walking around.</p>

<p>Styles of architecture I saw included Greek Revival, Second Empire and Italianate. I saw novelist Anne Rice's former house Rosegate up for sale. A memorial stone to Jefferson Davis, president of the Confederate States of America, stood on the sidewalk in front of Payne House, where he died. Near the interesting aqua-colored Commander's Palace Resturant, I peered through a locked gate into Lafayette Cemetery No. 1 with its above ground tombs and vaults.</p>

<p>Taking the St. Charles Streetcar back to the hotel required patience. As I and others waited, streetcars kept passing us completely packed with passengers. Finally, I boarded one that had a bit of room left. Back at the hotel room, my mom got up from her nap and we headed together to the French Quarter to eat at Red Fish Grill. I had some pretty good food with gulf shrimp and found the raw oysters interesting.</p>

<p>Back to the hotel we went to get ready for the evening TPAA Natchez River cruise. When we went to the lobby, we found a large crowd of TPAA members and their families also ready to go. While waiting, I saw an American Idol camera crew doing some interviewing just outside the doors. A team of buses picked us up and took us to the riverfront near the Steamboat Natchez. Eventually, we boarded and got on our way. Soon, we got in lines for each dish and had local cuisine served to us such as shrimp gumbo.</p>

<p>I spent most of my time hanging out with my friend Joe on the top, outside deck and sometimes we talked to two young women he also knew. When eating, we listened to some of the CD that my dad made of him singing Elvis Presley hits. Most of the shoreline scenery we passed consisted of either industrial docks or petrochemical plants, which lighted brightly at night. Later, in the interior, I saw that some TPAA members passed the time with music and dancing, some of it Thai style.</p>

<p>Some of the youth tried entertaining themselves on the top deck with their own music. I decided to go down to the bottom to look at the sternwheel in action. Joe followed. I also took a look at the really hot steam engine room as it worked to move the boat. When the boat returned to dock, we took one of the buses back to the hotel. I stopped to look at the big room where Joe and his parents stayed, then went back to mine to sleep.</p>
