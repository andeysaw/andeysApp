<p>For second time on the road trip, we did not have to break camp. We just got up and got ready, then drove to the northeast end of Devil's Lake. From there, we started up the East Bluff Trail to find Elephant Rock. After searching around the area we thought it might be, we failed to find it. But, we did find the small opening of Elephant Cave before returning to the car.</p>

<p>We left the park and headed to the town of North Freedom, parking at the Mid-Continent Railway Museum. When the museum opened, we went into the historic 1894 depot to buy tickets for the 10:30 train ride. With about an hour until then, we read the displays in the depot about the history of the railroad in the area and its connection to iron mining, then went outside.</p>

<p>Next to the depot, we saw an extensive display of restored rail cars. The display included coaches, box cars, locomotives and a rotary snowplow. I could climb up steps to look inside some of the cars. I also saw an automobile adapted for rail. Before getting a good look at the cars housed inside the Coach Shed, my brother and I realized it was time to board the tour train.</p>

<p>An authentically-attired conductor punched our tickets and, as the train went underway, talked to the group in coach about the train, rail and sights we passed on the seven mile journey. We found out that we had to go at a slow pace not because of the abilities of the diesel engine, but because the rails were antiques laid down in 1903. Along the route, we crossed over a couple trestles and passed the site of the town of La Rue, which now only had a tavern left.</p>

<p>At the end of the line near Quartzite Lake, we got out and the conductor went about taking pictures of people, including us, in front of the engine. I read a display about the damage caused to the area during a flood that occured in 2000. We then watched as the engine got reconnected to the other side of the train, so we could go back the way we came.</p>

<p>Because no one had bought tickets for the caboose for this ride, we and a couple others got the chance to ride in it on the way back. We picked its high seats. Then, after we arrived at the depot, we returned to the Coach Shed to see the rest of the restored rail cars. Platforms connected by steps let us look inside the detailed interiors, some with dummy people. One of the baggage cars had displays about the history of train engineering with photographs of engine assembly and diagrams and models of train function.</p>

<p>After seeing everything we could at the railway museum, we drove to Baraboo, where we went to the Circus World Museum, located at the site of the original Ringling Bros. Circus Winter Quarters. We entered the Irvin Field Exhibit Hall and Visitor Center and started our visit looking at displays showing colorful and grand old circus posters. Also, we read about the history of the Ringling Brothers and their circus. One room had large displays of costumes and props used in spectacles.</p>

<p>We went outside, crossed the bridge over the Baraboo River, then headed into the W.W. Deppe Circus Wagon Pavillion. Inside, we found restored, detailed, fanciful wagons that circuses used in the days when they traveled from town to town using horses. Other wagons were the kind used in the days that trains transported circuses. Somebody put quarters into a calliope in the building and we enjoyed some of the mechically played music.</p>

<p>We joined a guided tour of the C.P. Fox Wagon Restoration Center to see the place were people restored the circus wagons, but we dropped out of the group when they headed to the pavillion we just visited. Instead, we checked out the Cookhouse Theater, where a clown entertained the crowd while showing a little girl how to apply clown makeup. After that and looking inside the gift shop, we stopped to listen to a Gavioli Concert, mechanically playing its music while showing an elegant display.</p>

<p>In the Ring Barn, we discovered exhibits about various aspects of life in the circus. For example, one display had to do with the three basic types of clowns and another talked about circus music. In the middle of it all, a grand display under glass showed a bustling circus in miniature. We could press buttons on the side to make particular parts of the display animate, causing acrobats to rotate on iron jaws and getting an elephant to push a cart out of the mud.</p>

<p>A program began dealing with dogs in the practice ring, but we decided to explore the grounds instead. It turned out, almost everybody else went with the program, because we found a nearly deserted park. We found camels in one corner and goats nearby, then walked to an area know as The Backyard, where we saw ponies and elephants that people could ride, for a fee. I would have tried the camels if they were available, because I had already ridden horses and elephants in the past.</p>

<p>Life came back to the park as people arrived to see a demonstration of horses helping load carts onto a circus train. In The Backyard, I successfully walked across a low balance beam, but my brother did not. We also sat on a unicycle fixed in place, just to see how it felt. Then, we and the small crowd shuffled into the Big Top for the a traditional circus performance.</p>

<p>The show started with the announcer, who introduced an acrobat. She clung high off the ground on a long piece of fabrice, doing her act. Then a clown with trained dogs showed off tricks, including dogs leaping over things, one running on a rotating table and finally, one riding a small scooter. After that, the acrobat returned to do acts on a high swing, including rotating using an iron jaw.</p>

<p>The live band played its music when the camels came out mainly to just parade around the ring. After that, the clown returned and did a comedy act on his own, pretending to be clumsy while handling a broom and a plastic garbage can. It got quite a few laughs, mainly from the kids in the audience. The elephants then came out and did simple moves, like balancing on platforms.</p>

<p>At one point, one guy announced the sale of peanuts. If you bought the package of peanuts, then you were eligible for a prize. The prize, which just about every buyer got, turned out to be a cheaply made flag, so I was glad I didn't buy any peanuts. For the finale, the band played patriotic music while the performers waved flags. A huge flag unfurled at the end.</p>

<p>After leaving the big top, I took a picture of my brother with the clown, then we went back to the car and drove to our campsite at Devil's Lake State Park. With the weather looking a bit threatening and us feeling a bit tired, we decided to relax. We ate some dinner and showered, then went to sleep. I woke up later, though, because a thunderstorm hit and lightning kept flashing almost constantly as heavy rain fell. It did not bother my brother, though and I did not feel I could do much, so I went back to sleep.</p>
