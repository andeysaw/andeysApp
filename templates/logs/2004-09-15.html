<p>In the morning, Billy and I went to the local car wash in Lynnwood. When everbody was ready for the day, we checked out of the hotel and headed south on the interstate, stopping briefly at the Costco in Aurora Village. My sister wanted to check out one of the largest malls in the area, so we ended up at the Southcenter Mall. She didn't find it that impressive and eventually, we continued on our journey south.</p>

<p>When we finally reached Portland, we headed into the Oregon Museum of Science and Industry, even though we only had an hour there before it closed. At least we got admission at a reduced price, possibly also because several areas were closed for upcoming exhibits. First, we went upstairs to see exhibits on the life and earth sciences. The family enjoyed the age machine to see themselves as older using a computer program. Liam enjoyed seeing the fossils.</p>

<p>The kids had a lot of fun downstairs, especially playing with the models demonstrating principles of physics, like a machine where you mix a pressurized mixture of air and water and see how far a bottle launches upward. I had to pry them away from that one to try other things. At the end, they tried to play at least a little bit with every contraption in the area, right up until closing time forced them to go.</p>

<p>We drove not too far away from the museum to get to the Lloyd Center, where my sister wanted to do more shopping. I found out the place had a sizeable skating rink, where I heard Tonya Harding used to practice. When we finally got on our way, we continued south. I helped them look up hotels to stay in along our route and we settled on staying at a Super 8 Motel in Grants Pass. We slept soon after we checked in.</p>
