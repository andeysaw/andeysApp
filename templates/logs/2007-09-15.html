<p>I got in a bit of sleep on the flight then woke to see clouds outside. I tried to find my position on the map on the Red Entertaiment System, but it stayed frozen, so I just browsed the games, music and videos, including music videos and student films. The plane ended up arriving at John F. Kennedy International Airport a little bit earlier than scheduled. I claimed my bag and then took AirTrain to Jamaica Station, where I transferred onto the subway.</p>

<p>I exited the subway in Midtown Manhattan and noticed Times Square not far away. I walked the other way past the Ed Sullivan Theater to the building where my friend Pat stayed. The front desk called him down and then we went to his apartment where we chatted and I dropped off my luggage. He had an air bed I could use in his small and sparsely furnished place and had a decent view far above the street. I soon got on my way, wanting to start sightseeing.</p>

<p>I stopped first at NYC &amp; Co to get visitor information and found out I could not get my Citypass from my voucher at The Cloisters, so I headed to the Museum of Modern Art just to get the Citypass, then took the subway a long way to Northern Manhattan. From the station, I walked through the northern part of Fort Tryon Park, enjoying the cool morning. On the top of the hill stood the extension of the Metropolitan Museum of Art known as The Cloisters.</p>

<p>I entered into the medieval style building, going up an arched passageway to the admissions desk. After presenting the Citypass, I entered the rooms filled with artifacts from the middle ages such as altarpieces, frescoes, sculptures, tapestries and stained glass. I accidently took a prohibited flash photo in the Fuentidue&ntilde;a Chapel and got a small warning, so I carefully checked my settings before taking subsequent photos.</p>

<p>The museum showcased four cloister gardens of diferent styles as well as a terrace overlooking the Hudson River. I saw birds flying about in the Trie Cloister. From there, I entered The Treasury to look at small precious items such as jewelry and illuminated manuscripts. After looking through every room in The Cloisters, I left and headed south on a scenic path through Tryon Park until I reached the subway station at 190 Street.</p>

<p>I exited the subway in Harlem and walked over to an eatery named Toast. I ate a sandwich and fries while people-watching. I also got a call on my cell phone. When done with lunch, I briefly checked out part of Riverside Church then continued to Columbia University. I saw some sort of street fair at the gate and then entered campus, looking at the architecture, especially of the Low Library and St. Paul's Church as well as noticed some sculptures on my walk east.</p>

<p>Past campus, I walked along Morningside Park until I reached the Cathedral of St. John the Divine, where I examined the exterior, especially the highly decorated doors. Nearby, I found the Peace Fountain with its sculpture of the sun on one side and the moon on the reverse. Smaller sculptures surrounded the main one, some separate from the fountain. When I finished looking around there, I walked until I reached the northwest edge of Central Park.</p>

<p>I referred to the park guide post for orientation and decided to head first to Harlem Meer to look at its lake. From there, I walked over to look at the Lasker swimming pool being converted into an ice rink. I continued on to the Ravine area to see the Huddlestone Arch and a small waterfall in the Loch, then headed up to the Conservatory Garden to see its fountains and styled plants. I saw a couple getting wedding related pictures taken there.</p>

<p>A bit of a walk later got me to the Reservoir, where I found a counter-clockwise jogging path that I followed, stopping to photograph buildings, birds and the fountain in the Reservoir. The afternoon sun produced a small rainbow on the fountain spray. At the south end, I left the jogging path and headed to the Metropolitan Museum of Art, first stopping at the Egyptian obelisk and a statue of three bears before going through the museum main entrance.</p>

<p>After getting a map of the huge institution, I started my visit on at the Cantor Roof Garden to check out the view of the edge of Central Park as well as see the metal abstract sculptures of Frank Stella. Then, I worked my way to the massive European paintings collection where I searched for the masterpieces mentioned in my guide book, such as Toledo by El Greco, but I tried to give each piece at least brief attention.</p>

<p>I went downstairs next to see the newly renovated Greek and Roman galleries. The museum in particular featured one open and airy square room that had a compact collection of classic statues. I moved on then to the impressive Egyptian collection, starting with the Temple of Dendur, which had its own room. I also enjoyed the Tomb of Perneb and other funerary items. Next, I visited the American Wing with its collection of period rooms and paintings.</p>

<p>I glimpsed at some of the European period rooms and armor as well as a special exhibit of abstract expressionism on the way to the modern art section, where I took note of paintings by Georgia O'Keefe and Picasso. Then, I cut across the museum to the Asian art section, where I found particular interest in the Jain temple ceiling and the Japanese Astor Court. With the remaining short time, I rushed through whatever I missed before finally leaving.</p>

<p>I took the subway back to Pat's building and then called him near his place only to encounter voice mail. Unfortunately, he had not made a copy of his key yet for me, so I headed to the nearby Westerly Natural Market to buy soup and apple juice which I then ate outide his place. When I finally reached him, he told me he had been out walking. We entered his place and then he went out again while I stayed to prepare for the next day before sleeping.</p>
