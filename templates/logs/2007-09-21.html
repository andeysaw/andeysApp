<p>I woke up with plenty of time until the American Museum of Natural History opened, so I took the subway to Union Square and bought gala apples at the Greenmarket for breakfast. I explored the square then looked at the Flatiron Building and checked out Madison Square Park, which had stainless steel sculptures of a tree and boulder in addition to classic statues. I then reached private Gramercy Park and peered through the gates.</p>

<p>I encountered the Theodore Roosevelt Birthplace just before its opening time so I waited by the brownstone then entered to see the first floor exibits about the president's life. I did not have time for the tour of the rest of the house. Back at Union Square, I took the subway. As I transfered lines at the 14 Street, 8 Avenue station, I saw animal figurines placed on supports. At 81 Street I almost entered the wrong way into the museum directly from the station.</p>

<p>I got outside and quickly found the visitor entrance with its steps and banners highlighting exhibits. In the lobby stood two tall dinosaur skeletons. I entered using CityPass and headed directly for the Hayden Planeterium. An elevator took me and others into a dark waiting room with video screens talking about space. We then got called into a room with highly reclined seats and watched the show Cosmic Collisions on the interior of the dome.</p>

<p>Afterwards, I saw a short visual effects show about the Big Bang. Then, I set about exploring the rest of the Rose Center of Earth and Space, seeing scientific concepts such as the scale of the universe illustrated in models and exhibits teaching about rock types. After a quick wander, I went to the top floor of the museum to see the impressive rooms of dinosaur skeletons and other large, ancient animals. I ate a grilled chicken Caeser salad at Caf&eacute; on 4.</p>

<p>From the skeletons I then saw fully fleshed models of mammals and birds, most of them with a mockup of their natural habitat in display windows. I went on to see the cultural halls, starting with one on Eastern Woodland Indians. The Mexico and Central America Hall had large stone carvings. In the Pacific Peoples Hall, I liked the giant Moai statue. On the first floor, a huge Haida Canoe by Northwest Coast Indians impressed me.</p>

<p>Between the extensive culture halls and animal displays, I also saw an exhibit on human origins that included a couple of the oldest human remains found. The Hall of Meteorites had the huge Cape York Meteorite and the Hall of Minerals had lovely displays of precious stones. I visited the Milstein Hall of Ocean Life just as it started shutting down for an overnight program. Workers layed out cots on the lower section.</p>

<p>A made a last quick look at a couple remaining exhibits then walked across Central Park, first stopping to get a hot dog from a cart. After 6 PM, the Whitney Museum of American Art allowed visitors to pay whatever price they wished, so when the time came I entered for one dollar and went first to Mark Bradford's paintings on the first level, pieced from public signage. I found the exhibit uninteresting.</p>

<p>I took the elevator to the fourth floor in time for a guided tour of Rudolf Stingel's work. The first room had walls covered in aluminum foil on foam-backed insulation written and carved into by design by the public. I saw no room left to add anything. I stuck around there for a while for the tour then left he crowd to see Stingel's other pieces showing different large surfaces of materials, sometimes on the floor to step on.</p>

<p>One level up, I glanced at various photographs by Danny Lyon then checked small, crude circus models by Alexander Calder. An old film showed the artist manipulating the models to create a circus performance. The second and third floors were closed in preparation for new exhibits. I last went to the basement to check out the gift shop and an odd gift vending machine.</p>

<p>I took the subway down to the Chelsea area and stopped in the Crispy Pizza Cafe to eat cheesecake. Then, I entered the Rubin Museum of Art during its free night. The first floor had a bar with music playing and people hanging out. I headed directly to the top floor to look at the Himalayan art then worked my way down. When done, I ended up seeing a free art film <em>Le Grand Voyage.</em> I took the subway at a late hour back to Pat's place to sleep.</p>
