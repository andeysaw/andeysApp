<p>I got up before Pat again and quietly ate my cold yet still tasty leftover pizza. I took the subway to its southern end, then walked over to Battery Park's Castle Clinton, where I already saw a line forming for the Circle Line Ferry. It grew quickly after I joined. When the gate opened, I picked up my reserved tickets for admission to the Statue of Liberty and use of the ferry and audio tour. I then quickly headed for the dock for the security screening and boarding.</p>

<p>I sat on the starboard side to get a good view of Liberty Enlightening the World as we approached the island. Upon landing, I headed to the security tent to gain entrance to the statue base. For the first time, I passed through a machine that checks for explosives residue by analyzing the result of puffing air on a person. Finally, in the base, I looked at a replica of an old version of Liberty's torch before going into the museum about the statue.</p>

<p>Partway through the museum, I returned to the lobby for a ranger talk that ended up happening in the museum. I then continued through the exhibits, learning about the different aspects of the statue construction and how the statue eventually became an important symbol in the nation's consciousness. Done with the exhibits, I then found the elevator up, but opted to take the stairs when I found out about that choice.</p>

<p>At the top of the base, I peered through windows in the ceiling showing the interior of the statue. Then, I stepped outside to enjoy great views of New York Harbor as I circled the statue. I continued down each level of the base, each time circling until I exited one-way gates. I then picked up the audio tour and followed its instructions, leading me around the island while informing me of its history. I then took a break writing postcards before hopping on the ferry.</p>

<p>The ferry stopped at Ellis Island, where I disembarked and entered the Main Building, once the center of immigration proccessing activity. I picked up an audio guide and started the self-tour by a large display of immigrants' luggage. The tour then led me upstairs to the Great Hall and the surrounding rooms. Exhibits in each room showed various aspects of the immigrant experience there and a comprehensive history of the island.</p>

<p>Partway through the audio tour, I stopped in the theater for a ranger talk and film about the immigrant experience called <em>Island of Hope, Island of Tears.</em> I felt a bit sleepy while comfortably seated. Later, after I finished the audio tour, I found an exibit showing immigration statistics in large, colorful displays. Outside stood the long American Immigration Wall of Honor. I wandered around it looking at names and also enjoyed the view of the harbor.</p>

<p>The ferry took me back to Battery Park, where I began exploring Lower Manhattan, first noticing an exhibit showing photos of the area recovering after the World Trade Center collapse. Nearby stood a mangled public art piece with a memorial plaque. Moving on, I walked toward Wall Street, passing the bull statue, then stopping by the New York Stock Exchange and Federal Hall. I wandered around inside Federal Hall looking at its exhibits and historic documents.</p>

<p>A short walk later, I ended up at Trinity Church. I looked inside and then checked the graveyard outside, noting the graves of Robert Fulton and Alexander Hamilton. Meanwhile, outside the gates, busy-looking people rushed on their commutes from work. I took a leisurely stroll that led me to a waterfront with sculptures and then the World Financial Center with its airy but enclosed Winter Garden, which I did not enter.</p>

<p>I took the subway to Penn Station and bought a pretzel from Aunt Annie's Pretzels to stave off hunger. Then, I hurried over to the Empire State Building as the sun began setting. From the lobby I took the elevator to a room with a quickly moving line. After pictures were taken per group, I picked up an audio guide then took the elevator to the observation deck where I watched the buildings light up as the sky darkened, checking every side at least a couple times.</p>

<p>After the great view, I returned to the lobby to look at a couple window displays, admire the interior design and look at stained glass panels of ancient wonders of the world. I had enough time left over to go to the top of the huge Macys store and eat a bland pizza at Jimmy's Pizza inside. On the top floor sat a small display about the movie <em>Miracle on 34th Street.</em> I hopped on the subway when done then got into Pat's place to sleep.</p>
