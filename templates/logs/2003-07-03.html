<p>After we woke up, got ready and broke down camp at Grand Beach, we headed right away to Winnipeg. However, we came too early for our first destination, so we searched unsuccessfully for an open grocery store. Then, we went to the Canadian Automobile Association office when it had just opened and obtained a map of the city as well as maps of Saskatoon and Regina.</p>

<p>Soon after it opened, we then entered the Royal Canadian Mint to see its modern coin minting operations. We paid the small admission fee and went upstairs, where first we saw exhibits explaining briefly the history of coins as well as how modern coins go from design to reality. Then we walked by windows, where we could see down into rooms of the production facility. Not many people seemed to be working there. Either I got there earlier than them or they stayed out of sight from the viewing windows.</p>

<p>Regardless of the lack of people, I got to see some machinery in action. I saw cast bars rolled into strips and coin blanks being punched out from strips. I found the coining room of particular interest to watch as rows upon rows of machines quickly stamped the blanks into legal tender. Back on the first floor, I looked at the interesting and varied commemorative coins as well as coins of other countries that Canada has produced. One wall with viewing holes let us see some of the gold coins the mint has made. Also, I saw a couple of lovely holographic coins.</p>

<p>Going from modern to Victorian, we headed next to the Dalnavert Museum, once home of Sir Hugh John Macdonald, Premier of Manitoba around 1900. Two young women in Victorian dress greeted us and, after paying admission, one of them took us on a tour of the upper class family home. We started in the kitchen, where we saw some of the gadgets of the time made to make cooking easier. We moved from the servant area to the lovelier reception and living area that guests of the Macdonalds would see. The rooms held a great collection of Victorian furniture and other items.</p>

<p>Soon, we went upstairs, where we saw a beautiful stained glass window on top of the stairs. Then, we checked out the bedrooms and bathrooms. A small, but symbolic step down led to the servant's quarters, which I found much smaller and bleaker. Smaller radiators meant colder rooms too, in cold weather. In the attic, we found a small museum exhibit with some artifacts, photographs and dresses of the time. We ended the tour in the basement, which held antique laundry equipment and the museum store.</p>

<p>For lunch, we decided to eat at the inexpensive Golden Boy Cafeteria, which happened to be located inside the Manitoba Legislative Building. Before going in the building, though, we took a look at the statue of Golden Boy on the top of the dome. Besides security, we got greeted at the inside entrance by a staircase with life size bison statues gracing the end of each bannister. We passed that and went downstairs to the cafe, where I ate an ordinary tasting sandwich.</p>

<p>We headed next for The Manitoba Museum, where we found a free, limited time place to park. We bought admission to the museum galleries and entered to find a grand display of a M&eacute;tis hunting bison on the plains. Then, we continued to the Earth History Gallery to take brief looks at exhibits on two levels showing fossils and explaining the geologic history of Manitoba. An Inukshuk rock marked the entrance into a faux snow tunnel with a display of a polar bear with a fresh kill. Then, we saw exhibits about life in the arctic and sub-arctic area of the province, including displays about the caribou migration and the tools and clothes of the Inuits.</p>

<p>Moving on, we encountered the exhibits on two levels about natural and human life in the boreal forests. One interesting display showed us just how many biting insects abound in Manitoba. We next entered the Hudson's Bay Company Gallery, which showed artifacts from the fur trading era and about a trading ship called the Nonsuch. I looked into one room and, to my surprise, found inside it a full size replica of the Nonsuch. We walked around the recreation of English waterfront buildings then boarded the ship to look around.</p>

<p>Time ran out on parking, so we re-parked the car a few meters from the old spot and returned to the museum. We found an unfinished area where we could preview the new Parklands/Mixed-Woods Gallery. It did not show that much. The Grasslands Gallery showed a sod house and a tipi, which you would find in early European settlement days. I briefly looked in the tipi and saw people in it, apparently being given a talk. Displays also showed the development of agriculture in the grasslands.</p>

<p>An exhibit about mass migration to Manitoba started our time in the Urban Gallery, where we saw a sample of what Winnipeg may have looked like in the boom time of the 1920s. We explored the false stores, going inside to look at items. Some parts had second floors that we could also visit. Inside the theater building, we found a Charlie Chaplin silent film playing and sat to watch it for a while, trying to make sense of the antics.</p>

<p>Done with the museum, we then drove to the French part of town to see its most famous building, the Saint-Boniface Cathedral. The ruins of the 1908 basilica, destroyed by fire in 1968, surrounded the modern church. A huge hole in front marked the place that contained a circular window. We walked around the ruins as well as the graveyard, which included the grave of Louis Reil, a famous Manitoban.</p>

<p>Across the river from there, we made it to The Forks Shopping Center. We only glanced at the shops, making our way up to the view from an observation tower. Back down, we then walked around outdoors a bit to a bridge before returning to the car. We took a quick drive around the streets of the Exchange District to see the terra cotta and cut stone architecture. Before leaving the city, we passed through Chinatown, then stopped at a grocery store for trip supplies.</p>

<p>Not too far to the north, we reached Birds Hill Provincial Park, home of the Winnipeg Folk Festival, which would happen a week later. We registered and set up our tent on a site we reserved. With daylight left, we explored the park roads by car, then stopped for a distant view of the park's artificially created lake. Back at camp, we then did our cooking, ate, showered and slept.</p>
