<p>I got up and packed a little bit before Chris, so I took a walk down to the boat ramp for Trillium Lake and saw a beautiful reflection of the surrounding forest. Back at camp, I had Chris go along with me to the fishing pier, where we saw a great view and reflection of Mount Hood. Other people there just relaxed and fished by the view. I also watched some ducklings gathering by the shore until someone scared them away.</p>

<p>We left the campground, then stopped to obtain a Northwest Forest Pass for the day at Mount Hood Foods in Rhododendron. Chris got some breakfast items there. Further west in the town of Zigzag, we stopped at the ranger station to get more information about the Mount Hood National Forest. Across the street from there, we found the road that led us to the trailhead for Ramona Falls.</p>

<p>The hike started alongside Sandy Creek with a sandy trail until we reached a hiker bridge over the creek. Soon, we hit a junction and turned left to do the trail clockwise. For much of the trail, we stayed close to Ramona Creek, sometimes crossing it. I had to sign in for a permit when we entered the Mount Hood Wilderness. The trail turned right when we came upon a tall basalt cliff.</p>

<p>When we reached the impressive sight of Ramona Falls, we immediately felt much cooler than before. For lunch, I sat a bit far from the waterfall so I would not get too cold. Plenty of pictures later, we continued clockwise on the loop trail. This part of the trail felt warmer and was less scenic than the way to the falls and I walked quickly through it. When we reached the parking lot, we noticed someone had driven a minivan onto a trail closed to vehicles, getting stuck in the process. Fortunately, someone else helped them out.</p>

<p>Back in Zigzag, Chris got himself another Subway sandwich while I tried a scoop of ice cream. We returned east past Government Camp until we reached a remnant of the Mount Hood Loop Highway near Barlow Pass. There, we found a grave marked for an unknown pioneer woman and rock walls created by people who had used the Oregon Trail and tried to ford the East Fork of the Salmon River.</p>

<p>We descended into increasingly arid lands as we entered the Warm Springs Indian Reservation, making a quick stop at Mill Creek for a look into its gorge and a nearby historic sign about the area natives. In Madras, we fueled the car, then headed to The Cove Palisades State Park. For a while on our drive, we just saw a couple small towns and farmland. Only when we entered the park did we become impressed, seeing the tall canyon walls surrounding the blue Lake Billy Chinook.</p>

<p>We took a few pictures, then crossed the Crooked River Arm on a bridge before getting to the Deschutes Campground, where we set up our tents in the heat. After that, we stopped at the information center to gather information about the park. A thermometer there indicated a temperature above 100 degrees Farenheit, so we decided not to hike and just sightsee. The sight of distant lightning also helped convince us not to hike.</p>

<p>In my car, we headed to the upper and lower day-use areas of the Deschutes Arm of the lake to see the activities going on such as picnics and boating. Then, we took a road that led us on a narrow bridge over the Deschutes Arm and up to a good view of this part of the lake. We returned to the Crooked River Arm after that and visited the Marina, then continued up again for a view of this arm of the lake from above, now noticing distant snowy peaks as well.</p>

<p>I drove up to an area of overlooks at the rim of the canyon and got great views of the lake below. However, the storm clouds obscured the view of the snowy peaks on the horizon. I took the road up to the top of Round Butte anyway to check out the scenery. Then, we went back to Madras to eat dinner at the Black Bear Diner, not wanting to cook outside in the stormy weather. Back at camp, we showered, took a walk of the grounds after the storm cleared, then went to sleep.</p>
