<p>I wanted to make it to the Hidden Cave tour that started at the Churchill County Museum in Fallon, Nevada at 9:30 A.M., so I left my place at 2:45 A.M. Good music on the radio, a spicy snack and thoughts on my mind kept me awake as I drove straight on, making only one fuel and restroom stop in Folsom. Unfortunely at Twin Bridges on US-50, I had to put on tire chains to go over Echo Summit. I had not done this in a long time, so it took me a little while to get them on. In Myers I took them off, though I found the road still a bit slippery.</p>

<p>I put chains on again for the Kingsbury Grade's Daggett Pass and took them off before reaching the Carson Valley. Last night's snowfall had reached here too and many signs were covered by frost, making most of them unreadable. Fortunately, I could read the sign I had to find and made my way to the Wenzel's house, where Pui had been staying. I found her outside scraping the ice off the window of her Mustang. Not wanting to waste time, we soon got on our way to Fallon in her car.</p>

<p>As we headed east on US-50, we stopping seeing snow on the ground. When we arrived in Fallon, we turned right on Main Street, found the museum and parked. The place was far more crowded than I expected for a small museum in a small town. Apparently, most people there had come for the Hidden Cave tour, including a Boy Scout troop. I signed us up and then we spent time looking at the exhibits until everyone got called into a room to watch a short video about the history of the cave.</p>

<p>A Bureau of Land Management ranger met with us after the video to give us directions to the site to where we would caravan. Pui and I left for the site before most of the crowd and then walked around a little bit, looking at the rocky hills, waiting for everyone to show up. After gathering the group, the ranger started our walking tour, first showing us a few petroglyphs on a couple rocks. Then we walked up to an alcove incorrectly named Picnic Cave, where we saw tufa formations on the ceiling indicating that the place was once underwater.</p>

<p>Finally at the top of the trail, the ranger turned on the generator for the lights and opened the small door that led into Hidden Cave. Inside, we found one fairly large room with rubble on one side and an archeologically excavated area on the other. The place smelled of ammonia from bat guano. The ranger talked about the excavations that unearthed intact artifacts from thousands of years ago when the place had been used by natives as a storage cache. He also noted that the layers in the floor told a story of what happened geologically in the area over time.</p>

<p>When the ranger finished answering questions, we took a close look at the markings the archeologists had made. I saw one line in the rock layer that marked the location of ash that came from the eruption of Mount Mazama, which created Crater Lake in Oregon. Also, a couple places had spear shafts sticking out. When done, Pui and I immediately left the cave and the crowd behind, glad to be free of the highly restless mass of little boys. We continued on the loop trail, looking at faded red pictographs at an alcove named Burnt Cave before returning to the car under a light drizzle.</p>

<p>Pui felt hungry, so we returned to the town of Fallon and decided to eat at Anecita's Good Food Restaurant inside the Nugget Casino. It had simple, but tasty American fare. Our chatty waitress told us a summary of her life story, coming from Whittier, California and settling in Fallon for decades after meeting her sweetheart. Another waitress there uttered silly sound effects as she went about her work. When finished, we stopped in the casino to each bet $5. Pui ended up with about $25, while I lost most of my bet.</p>

<p>Feeling quite full, we headed back east, passing the Hidden Cave area and continuing past salt flats to Sand Mountain Recreation Area. Pui was impressed as soon as she saw the massive mountain of sand and wished she had brought her sled. We saw one group doing a little sandboarding, but most people there rode off-highway vehicles such as dirt bikes up and down the steep slopes. We walked out towards the dunes to climb them a little, but turned back when a drizzling rain started.</p>

<p>Back in the car, we headed back west, passing Fallon. I dozed off a little and found out a bit later that we had reached Fernley, which meant we had taken US-50 ALT insteaed of US-50. We had to head south on US-95 ALT and passed Silver Springs on our way to Fort Churchill State Historic Park. The only thing we saw here was the ruins of a U.S. Army fort built in 1861. We walked around them, reading the interpretive signs. Just as we were finishing the loop, it started lightly snowing.</p>

<p>I had never gotten around to using the Baskin-Robbins gift certificates that a friend had given me months before, so I finally spent them with Pui at a store in Carson City. We both got variations of the Banana Royal. With it being too late to go to any museum attractions in the capital city, we headed back to the house in Minden. Tom was there working like he had been all day. Pui started up her computer to play World of Warcraft, a massive multiplayer online role playing game.</p>

<p>We didn't plan anything else for the evening so I just hung around to use the internet, play with Yummy the cat, enjoy the view of bunnies and snowy peaks outside the windows and relax on the couch. For dinner, I only felt hungry enough to try some of Mrs. Wenzel's scalloped potatoes. I only had 3 hours of sleep the night before, so I easily fell asleep early. Tom woke me up so I could sleep on the fold-out bed, then I properly prepared for sleep before dozing off again.</p>
