<p>We woke early and could see outside that we had already arrived in Copenhagen. My brother and I met up with his friend Alisa and we all had an early breakfast at the buffet on deck 11. From there, I could see views of the port and other docked cruise ships. We had some time before our scheduled shore excursion, so decided to walk around town. When ready for disembarkation, we tried to leave through deck 3. However, the crew told us that, due to security, we needed to get to town by shuttle.</p>

<p>After passing through a checkout where they scanned our cabin cards, we headed for the shuttle, paying for the return-trip fare with our cabin cards. The shuttle took us to Nyhavn and from there we walked down Bredgade. Near Frederikskirken, a shower erupted but quickly ended. We then entered the grounds of Amalienborg Palace, where we saw a couple statues and some royal guards.</p>

<p>We continued on to the waterfront to see Amaliehaven Fountain and the marble columns around it. Across the water stood the new opera house. Walking along the waterfront, we saw more artwork and ships and stopped at a souvenir shop where I got some postcards and stamps. One building we passed had a wall with embedded display cases of different models of Maersk cargo vessels.</p>

<p>We made a stop next at Gefion Fountain, a large monument to the Norse goddess Gefyon, who mythically created the island of Zealand which includes Copenhagen. The statue on top showed Gefyon standing on a chariot ready to whip three bulls pulling it. We circled this fountain then looked at nearby statues of royalty and a flower garden. After a bit more lingering, we started heading back towards Nyhavn.</p>

<p>We returned to Amalienborg Palace just in time to see one of the guards exchange his post with another. I noticed that the guard getting relieved smiled briefly while talking to his replacement. From there, we continued to the domed Frederikskirken, more popularly known as Marmokirken or the Marble Church. We went inside and quietly looked around, noting the organs and the ivory crucifix. Outside, we circled the church while looking up at the statues that ringed the building.</p>

<p>We needed to get back on the shuttle to make it to our planned excursion, so we returned to Nyhavn, looking around at the colorful buildings before the shuttle arrived. Back at the ship, we checked in and went through security, then grabbed a late breakfast on deck 11. Steven and I met up with our parents and we boarded the tour bus that would take us first to Rosenborg Slot, after getting stickers put on us with our tour number.</p>

<p>When we exited the bus, our tour guide held up a Celebrity sign with an X and our tour number. The tour guide took care of the group tickets and then we entered the grounds and looked up at the castle and its towers. Guards in modern attire paced the building entrance. Inside, a man requested an additional fee for photography, but I didn't come up with the right amount of euros or kroner.</p>

<p>We first entered the rooms once occupied by King Christian IV. His Winter Room had inlaid paintings all over the wall. In his bedroom stood a display case with his clothes, including an ear ornament made with a splinter from a cannon that had once wounded him. I briefly peeked into his nearby indoor toilet that had emptied into the moat. We visited more resplendent rooms, noting unique furniture and gadgets of the period, then headed back outside.</p>

<p>Next, we went down into the basement, which featured rooms of display cases and windows containing royal items such as swords for kids and adults, horse riding gear, decorative tableware and sets of cameos. Further in, we entered the Treasury, which held the royal crowns and collection of jewelry and jeweled objects. A one-way passage from there led us back outside.</p>

<p>My brother and I walked around the castle grounds a little and crossed the bridge over the moat while waiting for the rest of the tour group. We then boarded our bus and headed over to Tivoli Gardens. The tour guide pointed out notable buildings along the way. At the front gate for Tivoli Gardens, our guide gained us admission and then gave us free time to roam the amusement park.</p>

<p>I walked around with my brother, using the park map to make sure we hit all parts of the park. We decided not to go on the rides due to time restrictions and lack of cash. For part of the time, Alisa joined us for the stroll. I noticed that the park used a variety of international architecture, from the Chinese Pantomime Theater to the Arabic styled Monsoon ride to the restaurant shaped in the form of a Frigate. I briefly met up with my parents by the Demon roller coaster.</p>

<p>After wandering past the rides, fountains, theaters, restaurants and statues in the park, I bought a postcard, then we headed back through the main entrance to the waiting tour bus. We passed by some interesting sights noted by our guide, including City Hall, Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek and the Stock Exchange with its spiral tower. For our final stop, we visited the forlorn statue of the Little Mermaid. A mob of tourists on both land and sea surrounded the small statue set on a shorefront rock pedestal.</p>

<p>I briefly saw a couple other statues near the Little Mermaid, then boarded the bus for the trip back to the ship. A quick moving line got us on board, first with a swipe of our ship card, then an x-ray scan of our bags. We stopped by our cabin, then I went to the top decks to watch the ship depart. With a better idea of the city layout, I looked around and spotted the towers in and around Tivalo Gardens.</p>

<p>After the deafening horn blasts, the ship departed and I stood at the railing, prepared for the cold marine wind. As we slowly left the protected harbor, I noticed an island with a sea wall with a few buildings including a light station. Near there, stood a bank of windmills which continued on pretty far into the sea. I also caught a distant look at the Ã˜resund Bridge that connects Copenhagen to the Swedish city of Malm&Oslash;.</p>

<p>I went down to the Grand Restaurant to join my family for dinner. My brother and I returned to the cabin to figure out what to do, consulting the &ldquo;Celebrity Today&rdquo; activites and events sheet. I decided that the night's feature entertainment might be interesting, so when the time came, we went up to the Celebrity Theatre to watch the &ldquo;Action Comedy Juggler&rdquo; Charlie Peachock. We ended up getting a seat way on the side balcony, but it sufficed.</p>

<p>A little of the show felt predictable, but overall I enjoyed the antics of the very talented juggler. I went to the Art Gallery to once again guess the price of a painting, this time a Chagall. Then, I checked out the sunset with my brother from the starboard side of Deck 6. After that, we did a little exploration of the outside part of the ship, climbing up the steps at the aft section of the ship. We found where the table tennis tables were stored and joked how someone playing right there would likely lose their ping pong ball to the sea. Later, I relaxed in the room, flipping through the limited number of channels on the television.</p>
