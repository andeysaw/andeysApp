<p>We woke up and got ready in time for the complimentary breakfast only to find a small selection of breakfast bars and orange juice. We ate there anyway while watching the local news. Out of caution, we topped off the gas tank for the long drive on US-50, which had very few gas stations, most with high prices. As we headed east, I pointed out landmarks such as Sand Mountain, petroglyph sites, Pony Express stations and a tree layered in shoes.</p>

<p>In the small mountainside town of Austin, we stopped at a gift shop featuring jewelry and filled with miscellanea. The shop keeper proudly displayed a mounted elk head she shot locally. I grabbed some free tourist information and then used the restroom at the bar next door. Chris walked up the street to mail a postcard from the post office. Our driving resumed with only a stop in Ely for gas and food before reaching Great Basin National Park.</p>

<p>We briefly stopped at the visitor center in Baker to look around at the scenery and obtain information. Immediately afterwards, we drove up the mountain road to Wheeler Peak Campground to grab a site. It looked like only a few remained as we drove around. After securing a spot, we quickly set up our tents while enjoying the relative coolness of being almost ten thousand feet in elevation. When ready, I drove us a short distance to the Bristlecone Pines trailhead.</p>

<p>It did not take long to reach the ancient, gnarled grove of Bristlecone Pines. A path led us past several interesting trees noted with interpretve signs. Some trees there had stayed alive for over 3000 years. After admiring their stark beauty, we decided we had time to extend our hike to the Wheeler Glacier. Soon, we started crossing snowfields and continued climbing until we hit the glacier edge. We watched a couple from Colorado continue onto the ice.</p>

<p>A bighorn sheep stuck around the area, allowing us good views of it as it grazed the rocky slope. After taking many photographs, we descended as the shadow of the peaks lengthened and the temperature dropped. Back at my car, we drove the short length to the campsite to eat dinner. I stayed up just long enough to admire a bit of the clear, starry sky the day after a new moon but then began getting too tired so went ahead and slept.</p>
