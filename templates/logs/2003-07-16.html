<p>We got up, ate breakfast in our room, then headed for the car in Lincoln Park. We found out that we parked in a spot that did not allow cars during rush hour. At least the car did not get towed. With no apparent place to park the car, we went ahead and drove to the Museum of Science and Industry to park in its garage.</p>

<p>When we entered the museum, we bought a Chicago CityPass, using it for admission to the exhibits plus an IMAX film. I let my brother decide where to go, so we first went to The Great Train Story, where we saw a grand model train exhibit. It had scale models of Chicago and Seattle as well as landscape of plains and mountains in between. As we moved around the model, we read information tied to the model on how trains have aided in travel and industry.</p>

<p>Above the exhibit suspended the body and one wing of a real 727 airplane. We got a view of landing gear rising and lowering with simulated sounds of takeoff, part of the exhibit called Take Flight. In an adjacent room, we looked around in an exhibit about genetics, trying out some of the interactive screens. In one corner, we saw a baby chick hatchery with adorable chicks.</p>

<p>The IMAX Movie we got tickets for started soon, so we went down to the theater and made it inside just in time. We watched a movie about coral reefs and their endangerment. Some scientists went to find out why the coral reefs near a Micronesian island were dying off. After the show, we took a look at an exhibit about the American Space Program just outside the theater.</p>

<p>Finding out that the U-505 Submarine would close in August for conservation, we decided to head there next. While waiting in line, we read about the German submarine and its capture in World War II. Each tour allowed only a limited group of people due to the cramped conditions in the submarine. When we got in, our guide showed us the controls and parts in each small room as we traveled down the length of the vessel and gave us an idea of the tough life of a submariner. The tour ended near the aft section and we got to look at a periscope aimed at a parking lot.</p>

<p>Going back upstairs, we next checked out an exhibit called &ldquo;Clocks as Performing Pieces.&rdquo; It introduced us to the history of measuring time and showed off an impressive collection of time pieces ranging from the sundial to the atomic clock. We saw some gorgeously crafted clocks. After that, we visited the Toymaker 3000 exhibit to see an illustrated working toy production line. We looked at all the automated steps, then left to see exhibits in the Balcony area.</p>

<p>We briefly looked at displays in an exhibit about recycling and in one about AIDS, then checked out the inside of the 727 of the Take Flight exhibit. Inside, we found airplane seats and interactive displays about flying commercial jetliners. After walking through a large scale model of a heart, we then went back to the car to eat and drive to the Museum Campus.</p>

<p>With our CityPass, we got into the Adler Planetarium and Astronomy Museum, where we picked one show to see in the Sky Theater as part of the pass. We entered the exhibits through a dark, starry room. The exhibits themselves interactively detailed basic astronomy about our solar system and the Milky Way Galaxy. Considering the clear day we had, we probably saw a real-time image of the sun in one display. Otherwise, it would have shown a recorded image.</p>

<p>At the scheduled time, we went to the Sky Theater to watch the show <em>Search for Alien Worlds.</em> Clearly, the presentation was aimed at a young audience as it tried to whimsically talk about looking for life on planets outside our solar system while showing images on the domed ceiling. Throughout, a supposed audience member, a precocious, inquisitive, but annoying little girl interrupted the presenter to ask pertinent questions.</p>

<p>After the show, we went downstairs to see an exhibit that showed beautiful historic items used in studying the sky. It also discussed theories from past schools of thought. Another interesting exhibit described how ancient people used light from the skies in their lives, building monuments marking seasons, steering by starlight, prophesizing and more. After that, we decided to leave the museum to see if the Mexican Fine Art Center Museum stayed open late that day. It turned out that it didn't, because the special late evening exhibit that had run there had already ended.</p>

<p>For dinner, we decided to eat at Pizzeria Uno, a place known for inventing Chicago deep dish pizza. However, we failed to find a suitable place to park in the Near North, so we parked the car for an overnight stay at a hospital parking garage near Arlington House. We took the CTA train to Pizzeria Uno and got on the waiting list. Having to wait a while, we had enough time to walk over and take a look at the historic Water Tower. We got back in time to get seated and eat the Numero Uno pizza.</p>

<p>We took our leftover pizza with us as we left the restaurant and headed for the John Hancock Center, talking an elevator high up to the Hancock Observatory. As soon as we exited the elevator, we joined a crowd looking out the window. It looked like we had arrived just in time to watch a fireworks show below at Navy Pier. After that, we leisurely walked around, enjoying the night views of Chicago, especially of the skyscrapers. I went for the kitschy tourist photo op of my brother pretending to be a window washer.</p>

<p>We did not want to get back to Arlington House really late, so we headed down the elevator and onto a CTA train, walking the rest of the way to the hostel. We took a shower right after returning and, despite feeling the least comfortable hot temperatures of our road trip, we managed to sleep.</p>
