<p>We got up an hour before sunrise, broke down camp and left for Kartchner Caverns State Park. With our early arrival, we figured we would likely get a walk-in ticket for a cave tour. Reservable tickets for this day had sold out long before my attempt to get them the week before. We waited in our car, behind two earlier arrivals. When the gate opened, the attendant assigned us to group number three.</p>

<p>First, we waited in the car, then found a heated snack room where could wait for the visitor center to open. When it did, we went in and quickly secured tickets for the Big Room tour at 11:15 A.M. With plenty of free time before the tour, we watched the film about the discovery of the caverns, explored the Discovery Center exhibits and then had a lunch of vegetables and noodles outside in the picnic area. While lunch cooked, I took a look at the Hummingbird Garden in front of the Discovery Center.</p>

<p>Our tour time came soon after we finished our meal. We met with our tour guides for the Big Room at the designated meeting area in the back of the Discovery Center. It turned out that the guide that would tail our group was Mark Kartchner, part of the family that owned the land we stood on before it got sold to the state. After making sure that we did not have any disallowed items such as cameras and bags and anything else that would add bulk that could bump against cave formations, we got on the tram to the cave tour entrance. Mark Kartchner pointed out the only known natural entrance along the way, now protected by a fence.</p>

<p>The man-made entrance contained a couple airlocks to help maintain the natural warmth and humidity of the caverns. In one of the passages, we received a fine mist to help dampen our clothes to lessen the shedding of lint. A concrete path made the walk quite easy throughout the whole tour, especially for one of our group using a wheelchair.</p>

<p>Although the Big Room itself had some grand displays of stalactites, stalagmites, draperies and flowstone, the smaller intricate formations became the real highlight of the tour. This included close looks at helictites, soda straws and formations known as fried eggs. We also saw excellent cave shields, brushite moonmilk, turnip shields and directional cave popcorn as well as tiny cave spiders suspended over holes. Mark Kartchner pointed out the original route the discoverers took into the room.</p>

<p>We exited back through the airlocks into the cold outdoors and rode the tram to the Discovery Center. Songyuan and I then left the park and headed to the town of Tombstone. Upon arrival, we checked out the Tombstone Courthouse State Historic Park, which now housed a museum about the town. Inside, we found displays about town life during boom times in the late nineteenth century. One display detailed the famous gunfight at the O.K. Corral. Of course, the musem also contained the courtroom. Out back stood the gallows.</p>

<p>After the museum visit, we took a quick walk through the historic section of town, passing the O.K. Corral. Just like other tourist-oriented &ldquo;Old West&rdquo; towns, we heard western dressed people announcing gunfights. We saw a couple people riding horses and a horse-drawn stagecoach passed through. Ignoring the call to see the last gunfight of the day at Helldorado, we left the area, next stopping at the Boothill Cemetary. There, we walked around, reading the epitaphs of people murdered, lynched and stabbed as well as one of someone who had smallpox.</p>

<p>We left the historic town and drove generally northeastward until we reached Chiricahua National Monument. So Songyuan could get a stamp in his national park &ldquo;passport&rdquo; book, we stopped at the visitor center, then went to the campground to set up our tent. We also got dinner cooking and went to sleep not too long after eating.</p>
