<p>Unlike other shore excursions, we would dock at Klaipeda in the late morning. That extra time allowed us a leisurely morning. As usual, I went up to deck 11 for a buffet breakfast and watched the land go by as we entered the industrial port full of large ships and cranes. We disembarked and soon found our tour bus to take us past the city to the Curonian Spit. The bus had to board a ferry to cross the lagoon. We got out and watched the scenery during the transit.</p>

<p>After landfall, the bus drove us for awhile until we reached the town of Juodkrante. We left the bus and started a walk up the Hill of Witches. Along a path on the hill stood a long line of wood carvings done in the 1980s of characters from local myths and legends. Our guide explained selected figures while people took snapshots with them. The stories had good creatures, gods, monsters, devils and witches. Some carvings had moveable parts or served as seats.</p>

<p>At the end of the story walk, good reigned again and we took a look at a small shop and the shore of the lagoon before boarding the bus. A bit of a drive later, we stopped at a restaurant within a lodge for a set lunch of meat, potatoes and vegetables. I finished quickly and wandered the quiet area near the lodge. When everyone finished, we boarded the bus again for a trip to Nida to begin a walking tour of the waterfront town.</p>

<p>Nida looked like a quaint seaside town with colorful cottages, some belonging to fishermen and others for rent. We walked through the streets until we got to the water, then continued along the shore. Along the way, we saw plenty of weathercocks on high posts. Each one used to represent someone's address in town with a symbol of the house and its surroundings. One place we passed had a dozen or so of them in one place.</p>

<p>Besides weathercocks, the area is known for its amber, so we checked out the Amber Gallery-Museum. Inside, the gallery had a couple small rooms filled with carved amber, like one shaped as a ship. It felt crowded in there, so I went out in back where they had a boardwalk with display capsules containing amber pieces. The path to the shore looked like a scene out of the game Myst. I had some time there to write postcards.</p>

<p>Eventually, we boarded the bus again for a ride up to a high view point of some sand dunes. The top itself had an obelisk and broken sundial with modern runes engraved on it. I could see some of the buildings in Nida, the Curonian Lagoon and the Baltic Sea. Our guide pointed out a distant watch tower marking the border with Russian Kaliningrad. After glancing at nearby table merchants, our group got on the bus for the long ride back to the ferry and Klaipeda.</p>

<p>I could not find stamps on the excursion, so I gave the guide my postcards and five Euros to send them with the remainder being a tip. Aboard ship, I returned to the cabin to relax and watch television. For dinner and view of our departure, I went up to the casual buffet area on deck 11. Afterwards, I headed to the Cinema room to hear a lecture on Viking history from Dr. Steve Call and learned more about who these people really were and how they got a fierce reputation.</p>

<p>When the time came, I headed to the Celebrity Theater for the featured evening enertainment. This time, a comedy magician Nick Lewan took the stage. He had an okay performance. Still with time to kill afterwards, I wandered the ship. Back in the cabin, I found a special offer on laundry. I filled up one bag with items priciest to launder to submit for a special fixed price. I saved at least a little money doing this. I went to sleep when done.</p>
