<p>I woke up early to catch my morning flight to Los Angeles. As I walked to the Bay Area Rapid Transit station, I was surprised to find a cafe along the way filled with people. It turns out they went there early to watch a World Cup match. I took the train then SamTrans bus to San Francisco International Airport. My early start gave me a good cushion of time as I encountered a long line to check in.</p>

<p>My American Airlines flight arrived at Los Angeles International Airport Terminal 3. I found out my parents and brother would arrive at Terminal 4, so I waited there until they showed up. Together, we checked into our Japan Airlines flight. While waiting, my dad, brother and I had a quick meal. I ate Japanese udon noodles.</p>

<p>It turned out that I did not sit close to my family on the flight, so I spent my time sleeping, reading or watching movies on the display screen in front of me. I watched the movie <em>Kate &amp; Leopold</em> and part of <em>Snow Dogs.</em></p>
