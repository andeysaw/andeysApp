<p>After packing up camp in the morning, we decided to see the waterfall after which High Falls State Park was named. We had some trouble finding the trail but eventually made it to the stream and waterfall. Judging from the level of water, we figured the stream must have been running low. At the bottom we discovered the easier, marked trail, but had to return the steeper way we came to get back to the car.</p>

<p>Done with our morning exploration, we headed south and stopped at Ocmulgee National Monument near Macon. With the help of the short, expertly done film and the museum of artifacts, I got a decent sense of the culture of the Mississippian natives that once thrived there. The park itself contained mounds built by those people. I had previously seen similar ones in Cahokia, Illinois.</p>

<p>A short walk from the visitor center was an earthlodge, reconstructed by archeologists in the 1930s. I was about to enter through the door when I saw what appeared to be a yellowjacket sitting on it. I was not patient enough to wait for it to leave, so I stayed back quite a distance and threw stuff at it, knowing there was a possibility it could get angry and repeatedly sting me. It flew back to the same area of the door several times until it finally flew away.</p>

<p>Entering the earthlodge through a narrow corridor, I came upon a window protecting the rest of the site. Pressing a button on it gave a description of the place and how it was used, complete with sound effects. It turns out the floor was the original one and could have been more than a millenia old. After I took pictures, we exited the building glad to see no more yellowjackets around.</p>

<p>We took off in our car to another area of the park that featured the mounds built by the natives long ago. First we walked up the steps on Funeral Mound, where village leaders were buried. Much of it was destroyed by a railroad cut in the 1870s. Next, we climbed the largest mound, the Great Temple Mound, where we could see the buildings of downtown Macon poking out of the trees. After also making it up Lesser Temple Mound, we left the park and continued south on a long drive through the rest of Georgia.</p>

<p>Soon after entering Florida, we made a stop at the state visitor center. There, I could find out more about our sightseeing options from hundreds of brochures. I also talked to a staff member for suggestions. They offered free samples of Florida orange juice at one counter, which we gladly drank.</p>

<p>We continued our long drive south. At one point we ran into a thunderstorm that became so intense that visibility became low. Many people slowed to a crawl trying to drive safely and some pulled off the road, though there were others still trying to drive fast. Fortunately, the thunderstorm was isolated and didn't last too long.</p>

<p>We realized by late afternoon that our AAA guidebook for Florida was missing, so we looked at the map for the nearest office to our location. We ended up going to Tampa where I got to the office right as it closed and someone was locking the door. Fortunately, they were kind enough to grab a guidebook for me as well as a city map of Tampa.</p>

<p>While in Tampa, we decided to take finish taking Interstate 275 through St. Petersburg and on the bridges over Tampa Bay. This was also our first look at the Gulf of Mexico to the right of us, where the sun was setting. We arrived at Koreshan State Park to camp only to find that it had already closed, so we decided our next best option was to search for places in Ft. Meyers Beach.</p>

<p>I thought, being a beach city, Ft. Meyers Beach would have a decent place to put a tent, but I only found ugly RV parks completely paved over. After two hours of searching, we discovered a halfway decent park and put our tent on a patch of grass. The office was closed by then and the bathroom was locked, but a kind resident of the trailer park let us borrow a key for the night so we could clean ourselves up before sleeping.</p>
