<p>We woke up and got ready for the day just in time for the breakfast room to open for the complimentary meal. We also had some time to help my dad check his email. He awaited responses from promoting a CD of 12 songs he sang that he planned to sell for charity. After eating, we took the tram to the Spui and headed to the Amsterdam Historisch Museum, but found we got there an hour early. I originally planned on doing Museum het Rembrandthuis first, but we ended up visiting that the day before, so I did not account for the Saturday opening time of this place.</p>

<p>We headed down to Magna Plaza to take a quick look inside, then went across the street to De Nieuwe Kerk. Using our &ldquo;I Amsterdam&rdquo; cards, we gained admission to the church and spent some time looking at the various monuments and painted glass windows. The choir screen was closed for renovation but a large sign described the sights inside with pictures and words. One unusual church window looked like a partially drawn curtain. It commemorated the anniversary of the liberation of the country in 1945.</p>

<p>After a thorough look at the church, we headed just outside to Dam Square to watch a little of the &ldquo;Beach Soccer&rdquo; going on. Then, we briefly looked at the costumed characters looking to catch the eyes of tourists, like a guy dressed as &ldquo;The Mask&rdquo; from a film of that name. Dad wanted to check out the nearby Madame Toussaud, but I objected. We turned down the crowded and busy Kalverstraat, passing a calliope and a large number of stores. Finally, we turned right into a courtyard and the entrance to the Amsterdam Historisch Museum, which had just opened.</p>

<p>After an introduction with an animated overview of the city's growth, we moved through the rooms of the history museum by ascending room number, therefore seeing exhibits arranged in chronological order, starting with the 14th century. Many exhibits showed local art and items from each period. The Golden Age around the 17th century had prominent representation in the building. Interactive exhibits included a model of a house pulley system and a small attic up steep stairs where one could try an organ that rang bells like in a church.</p>

<p>One room had a particularly impressive display of paintings. Next to that room, we encountered the special exhibit about the Fashion Palaces of 1880-1960. I don't have a great interest in fashion, so we skimmed the exhibits of mostly clothing. One little side room had mirrors and free standing flat cut-outs that we could stand behind to see what we looked like in old fashioned clothes. Only the cut-out of a boy's clothes was short enough for us. We returned to the permanent exhibits after this.</p>

<p>We moved into more modern time exhibits, including the period of French occupation. In the twentieth century exhibits, I saw a display of different types of housing that got built in the city, showing floor plans, photos and interactive displays, such as one that showed what rooms looked like in different eras. I liked the big wallpaper in another room showing bicyclists from four different eras. I also saw an exhibit around there showcasing children of diverse backgrounds.</p>

<p>The World War II exhibit area had a small upstairs attic with an old radio that &ldquo;tuned&rdquo; into one station. We then passed through information about the unrest of the 1960s and 1970s and a story about a squatter problem. A small white car sat on display, showcasing one of the solutions the city tried to improve traffic. The last room had a little theater and the recreation of the city's first gay and lesbian friendly cafe. On our way out, I realized I still had to check out the Regent's Chamber, restored as a remnant of the orphanage that once had existed there. It contained a table and chairs surrounded with large group portraits.</p>

<p>We left the museum and headed south through the Civic Guard Gallery, glancing up at the impressive old portraits of militia on each side. At the Spui, we found ourselves by the busy Jonk Herring Cart. Out of curiosity, all of us except my mom got the bread roll with raw herring. We used the discount coupon offered in the &ldquo;I Amsterdam&rdquo; book. We found a small bit of bench space in the crowded square and ate. I did not like the taste, but ate it all anyway. When done, we took a walk towards the red light district.</p>

<andeys-trip-pic class="left" data-trip-pic="world-press"></andeys-trip-pic>

<p>Right across from De Oude Kerk, we saw two windows with plump prostitutes. My dad walked a bit too close and the door automatically opened. We joked about that a bit. My focus was the grand church, though. We went inside to find a fascinating exhibit of journalism photos known as &ldquo;World Press Photo.&rdquo; First, though, I took a look at the architecture, admiring the organ, the pews with carved characters on them and the stained glass windows. Then, I walked around looking at the impressive photos taken from around the world.</p>

<p>One corner focused on Africa's troubles, with photos hanging off abstract tree structures. Elsewhere, the photos of African refugees washing up onto a tourist beach in the Canary Islands caught my attention as well as the prize winner of Lebanese youth driving past bombed out buildings. I also saw less serious subjects such as stylized portraits of people and sports events. At a different entrance to the church, I signed up for the next tour of the tower. My parents would not go, though, and decided to walk around the red light district.</p>

<andeys-trip-pic class="right" data-trip-pic="oude-steps"></andeys-trip-pic>

<p>My brother and I immediately had to climb steep stairs to get to the first level while a transplanted Canadian tour guide talked about the history of the city and features of the tower. We saw a bunch of bells and then continued up ladder steps to the outside observation level. From there, we got a great view of the city center. I could easily see a few other prominent towers belonging to other churches. We saw our parents at the bottom after the tour and headed north next.</p>

<p>I enjoyed the walk by the canals in the medieval center, but my parents felt a bit tired. They thought about resting while I checked out the Museum Amstelkring, but they ended up doing their own quick tour after they found that the Thai restaurant nearby they eyed had not yet opened. I followed a guide pamphlet telling me about each of the rooms of the seventeenth century house and ended up seeing plenty of religious artifacts and paintings. One room was devoted to the Miracle of Amsterdam.</p>

<andeys-trip-pic class="left" data-trip-pic="attic-church"></andeys-trip-pic>

<p>The highlight of the museum was the chapel &ldquo;Our Lord in the Attic.&rdquo; I found it interesting how the Dutch merchant Jan Hartman managed to put in a decent sized Catholic church in a house during those years when celebrating mass was officially forbidden. Three levels of seating faced a long, narrow open area containing a Baroque altar and a tall organ. The recommended tour route had taken us upwards to the chapel and then led us back down another way that brought us by the house's two kitchens before exiting.</p>

<p>Back on the street, we continued a little bit north, then turned east on Zedijk into Chinatown, passing the Kuan Yin Shrine. We then turned onto Oudezijds Voorburgwal, where we purposefully walked slowly past the prostitute windows, though we never stopped. The window girls dressed with little left to the imagination and had a bored look on their faces. We did stop just to look in the window of a shop selling marijuana. Near there, we came upon a group of people dressed as Star Wars characters, play fighting with &ldquo;light sabers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We walked back to Dam Square and took a short tram ride to Leidseplein, where we got the tickets for the Boom Chicago show titled <em>Me, MySpace &amp; iPod.</em> With time before the performance, my parents relaxed at the outdoor tables while my brother and I walked around. We found an open area of flowers lined up in evenly spaced stripes of pink, white and red. Among the flowers stood small clumps of lizard statues. After relaxing there, we met up with our parents and lined up for the dinner and show at Leidseplein 12.</p>

<andeys-trip-pic class="right" data-trip-pic="leidse-lizards"></andeys-trip-pic>

<p>We got seated in an upper back table. The people next to us arrived and started smoking. I am not accustomed to this in California, where smoking is highly restricted in restaurants, but I dealt with it and eventually got used to it. We first got served dinner, which tasted decent. Then, the comedy improv show started, using a combination of live stage and video screens. At the beginning, the comic would engage the audience, asking for certain words from which they would create a comedy skit, then play it out.</p>

<p>The first round of skits had the team of comics choose appropriately funny songs for certain situations, with the iPods as part of the props. During the break, indicated by music and a filling progress bar on the screens, my brother and I tried to explain MySpace to my dad. In the second act, we saw a skit based on the MySpace profile of an audience member, with her MySpace &ldquo;friends&rdquo; chosen as characters for the comics to play. They acted funny according to how she described them.</p>

<p>Overall, I enjoyed the show, but do not plan on being a repeat customer. It was a good way to spend the evening. We took the tram back and then my dad told us he had lost his 72 hour GVB ticket. At least the conductor let him on with his &ldquo;I Amsterdam&rdquo; card. We did not need that ticket much longer anyway. When we got back to the hotel, where we got most of our packing done on our last night before the cruise. Then, we did some checking of email and Steven did some online chatting before we went to sleep.</p>
