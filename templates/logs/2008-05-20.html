<p>After work, I took a shuttle to BART then continued to San Francisco International Airport. With a great deal of time until my flight, I chatted on my phone with my brother after checking in with Jet Blue. For dinner, I had a bland Lum Beef in Oyster Sauce, then wandered around the airport exhibit featuring Buddha images of Southeast Asia. I had seen all the other exhibits previously. When done, I passed through security without any problems.</p>

<p>I made a few more phone calls to pass the time and played games on my iPod Nano. I had never flown on Jet Blue before, so when we boarded I checked out the XM Radio and DirecTV entertainment. During the flight I also had my choice of snacks and a drink. The guy next to me became sick enough to have to sit still but the flight attendant gave him something to help him feel better. We then received earplugs and eyeshades but I only tried the eyeshades when I slept.</p>
