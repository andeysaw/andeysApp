<p>We woke up to a morning with light rain, but that did not bother us. What did bother us was a great increase in mosquitoes from the day before. Quickly, we put on protective gear, including mosquito head nets, and broke down camp.</p>

<p>When I stopped to register for the previous night, the women in the office told me that the mosquitoes came out in force because the area had rain for the first time in a long while. Every time we got in the car there, we searched for mosquitoes that entered and quickly smashed them. Despite these troubles, we headed to the viewpoint for Lower Tahquamenon Falls. While going to the point and back, I occasionally would look at my brother's back to see how many mosquites gathered clung to his jacket.</p>

<p>A short drive on the state highway took us to the more impressive Upper Tahquamenon Falls. We checked out two viewpoints, with the best one by the rim, and began getting soaked as the rain intensified. Back inside the car, we squashed the mosquitoes that flew in, then drove off to Whitefish Point to see the Great Lakes Shipwreck Museum.</p>

<p>The weather was overcast, drizzly and a bit cold at the point, but at least we had fewer bugs. First, we went to see the shipwreck exhibit, which had artifacts from ships that succumbed to the violent storms of Lake Superior, including the restored bell from the Edmund Fitzgerald, one of the most well known wrecks. When we went to the little theater next, it showed a film about the Edmund Fitzgerald and the raising of its bell.</p>

<p>In the building next to the light station, we found exhibits that gave an idea of life at the lightkeeper's place around 1900. Then, we went outside into the drizzle and checked out the beach along the lake. After taking a quick look at the museum store, we went to a smaller shop there to buy a quarter pound of fudge. I'm glad we didn't buy more, because I found it to be quite heavy and rich.</p>

<p>Because of the wet conditions, I decided to take the long, paved way to Grand Marais to enter the east end of Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore. The weather changed as we approached and became beautifully sunny and clear. We parked and then took the short hike to Sable Falls, continuing past it a little to the beach and its dunes. Then, as we went on to the Grand Sable Visitor Center, I noticed road construction. The ranger there informed us of the extent of the road closure and told us about the detour.</p>

<p>The unpaved detour turned out not to be that bad and we ended up close to the middle of the park. With time a bit pressed, we decided not to do a long hike I had hoped to do and instead did a good, brief one to Chapel Falls. Next, we visited Miners Castle, the only rock formation we could easily reach, seeing it from a scenic viewpoint as well as close up. From there, we made the brief drive to see Miners Beach, then took the short trail to Miners Falls, reading its interpretive guide pamphlet as we hiked.</p>

<p>Because they were so easy to visit, we checked out the three waterfalls near the town of Munising. At the far west end of Pictured Rocks next to town, we looked at Munising Falls. Then, just south of town we took a short walk to Wagner Falls. Right at the intersection of Highways 28 and 94 we could see Alger Falls.</p>

<p>Evening arrived and we took off to the town of Marquette, with a stop by a scenic rest stop to look for Scott Falls. I didn't find it after a minimal effort to search for it, and decided to continue to town. Once there, we checked in with Marquette Tourist Park and set up our tent there. We wanted to try some pasties, but found out it was too late to go to the Jean Kay's Pasties, judged to have the best. A campground attendant mentioned a 24 hour grocery store named Econofoods that could have some, so we left for it. Besides, we needed more trip supplies.</p>

<p>When we reached a road by the shore of Lake Superior, I was delighted to spot a huge rainbow in the sky over the water. I took pictures of the impressive arch, then we continued on to Econofoods to buy our supplies as well as a quick dinner. Too bad they had no more pasties, even if they didn't taste that good there. After that, we returned to camp to shower and sleep.</p>
