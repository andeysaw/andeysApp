<p>We woke up to a lovely, warm day. After breaking camp, we drove north to Wisconsin Dells to park near the dock for the boat tour of the upper dells. It shared the same lot as Ripley's Believe It Or Not! and the Wax World of the Stars. Some voice and animatronics sprang to life as we passed by a display in front of the wax museum, but we passed it with little interest.</p>

<p>With our pre-paid tickets on hand, we boarded the boat. Few people showed up for this tour, the earliest one scheduled for the day, so we had plenty of seating choices and sat in the front of the top deck. As the boat went north, a voice on the speaker gave us facts about the dells and told us the names given to rock formations on the sandstone bluffs, including The Pancake and Giant's Shield.</p>

<p>Despite Wisconsin Dells' many tourist traps, the banks of the Wisconsin River stayed natural looking, due to the state declaring the place a natural area. After some time between the cliffs, we docked in one cove and got out at a place known as Witches Gulch. I really enjoyed the scenery there as we walked on boardwalk through a slightly twisting, narrow passageway between cliffs. The walls soon expanded out and we ended up at a food and gift shop, where I bought a postcard. Then, we returned through the narrow corridor to the boat.</p>

<p>Not long after we got underway, we reached a wide area of the river where the shore flattened. Then, the boat docked and we got onto a boardwalk trail, walking to a tall rock formation known as Stand Rock. Following in a long tour tradition, a German Shepherd, on command, jumped across a gap to Stand Rock and back. I noticed a safety net under the gap.</p>

<p>As we headed to the boat after the jump show, we stopped by other rock formations such as Devil's Anvil and Toadstool Rock. While the boat returned to the dock, we had the chance to look at a souvenir booklet with pictures and stories about the upper dells, but we decided not to purchase one. As soon as the boat docked, my brother and I got back to the car and drove to the parking lot for the boat tour of the lower dells. With our pre-paid tickets, we boarded an almost full boat.</p>

<p>We got a good view of the dam that separated the dells as we got under way. On this tour, we had a guide that started the narration singing a hokey song. After that, the guide drew our attention to the cliff on one side to point out a formation known as the Cow in the Milk Bottle, which needed some imagination to see. We passed another formation soon after that named the Baby Grand Piano.</p>

<p>In a pleasant surprise, a bald eagle passed by us, carrying a fish in its beak. Then, another bald eagle passed us overhead. Our guide told us that we saw both bald eagles known to live in the area. We saw more wildlife on shore, as turtles made their way onto a beach.</p>

<p>The farthest south points of the tour had the most interesting looking sights. Lone Rock was an isolated island of rock wall with nests of small birds in one of its sheltered cracks. After that, we passed a house on a bigger rock island with a sign saying &ldquo;Island For Sale.&rdquo; Finally, we checked out an isolated wall of rock known as the Ink Stand before heading back north. Once again, we declined an offer to buy a souvenir booklet, this time for the tour of the lower dells.</p>

<p>When the boat docked, we hopped into the car and headed south until we reached the International Crane Foundation. We ate a quick lunch in the car, then went into the visitor center to pay admission and pick up audio tour devices for a self-guided tour. After looking at the wattled crane, we went to the circular Johnson Exhibit Pod, which featured thirteen more species of cranes, separated by fences. I really liked the spiky head of the grey crowned crane from Africa.</p>

<p>Halfway around the pod, we headed to the nearby Amoco Whooping Crane Exhibit. We didn't see any whooping cranes in the habitat, so watched the film about the restoration of the species. Then, we went back to the habitat, still not seeing any cranes. We read some more exhibits then looked in one last time to see two cranes slowly moving around. I enjoyed watching them walking in the grass and shallow pond.</p>

<p>We returned to the pod and saw the rest of the cranes, then walked the grounds to the area on the other side of the visitor center to see the Chick Yard. A woman there was taking care of two young cranes of different species. Inside the nearby Shroeder Exhibit Room, we saw a video and exhibits about raising crane chicks with human parents compared to raising them without their knowledge of human presence, to maximize their survival in the wild. After checking out an art exhibit featuring cranes, we went to the gift shop where my brother brought a chopstick holder with a crane design.</p>

<p>We left and drove south until we entered Devil's Lake State Park, first stopping at the visitor center to claim our reserved campsite at the Ice Age Campground. After setting up camp, we drove to the south end of Devil's Lake and saw many people enjoying the warm day. We left the crowded shore and began heading for the quartzite hills.</p>

<p>Past the rails, we found a sign cautioning against carrying the garlic mustard plant seeds on our shoes. A brush below the sign let us scrub dirt off of our shoes. After that, we headed to the steep, rocky climb of the Balanced Rock Trail. We got to the top and admired the view of the lake, but did not find Balanced Rock. We enquired a little about its location, then I realized we missed it going up the trail. I did not feel like going back down to see it.</p>

<p>I wanted to see at least one point of interest, so we took the easy high path until we reached Devil's Doorway. It was an interesting stack of rocks with a rectangular window through which we could see the lake. To complete a loop trail, we hiked down the steep Potholes Trail. We saw some small potholes at the top of the trail and hoped for more impressive ones later, but didn't find any more.</p>

<p>Daylight waned, but we still had some time, so we got back to the car and drove to the trailhead for Parfrey's Glen. As we headed up the trail, it became more scenic. We crossed a couple bridges over a stream then walked onto a boardwalk as rock walls rose on each side. At trail's end, we ended up by a small waterfall in the cool, shady gorge. After the lovely hike, we returned to the car and drove to camp to eat, shower and sleep.</p>
