<p>I woke up to find my flight had crossed the International Date Line, so the day became Thursday. We reached Osaka's Kansai International Airport that evening. My brother and I wandered around the terminal briefly before we had to board our next flight.</p>

<p>Just like the last flight, I got assigned a seat not near my family, so I traded seats so I sat near my brother. I also found myself sitting next to and in front of a group of Thai flight attendants flying to Bangkok for their next assignment. To my delight, the one next to me, Louktarn, starting talking to me, after noticing I was reading the flight menu in Thai. I asked if she knew another flight attendant I met last year, but she did not and told me many Thai flight attendants work for Japan Airlines.</p>

<p>When we arrived in Bangkok, my Aunt Nuch showed up to greet us. We then hopped into a van that transported us to the Radisson Hotel, where my family checked into two rooms. I did not get enough sleep on the flights, so had no problem sleeping once in my room.</p>
