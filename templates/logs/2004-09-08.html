<p>At Billy's behest, we started our trip with a long drive that started at nine o'clock at night. I already had a long day, having just flown back to Los Angeles from St. Louis after a visit with my parents, but I would try to help drive. Billy drove first, to Sylmar, then I drove. I started having trouble staying awake, so we stopped in Kettleman City to change drivers and get fuel.</p>
