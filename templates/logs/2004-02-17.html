<p>We woke up early and HaoFeng went to the nearby Kinko's to print something from his laptop. Then, we checked out and headed for the international border. Though the guy at Canadian customs seemed a little cranky, he let me through easily with my U.S. passport. However, HaoFeng was doing some sort of immigration landing, so we had to go into the immigration office. Fortunately, he had all his papers in order and we had little problem getting through there and customs.</p>

<p>HaoFeng got some currency exchanged and immediately took photos showing him entering Canada for the first time. I then drove us to the Scott Road Skytrain Station in Surrey. We parked there, bought day passes and rode the train all the way to the Waterfront Station in Vancouver. From there, we walked right to the Human Resource Centre where HaoFeng applied for his social insurance number. The process took so little time that he left with me to explore the city instead of me going on my own as previously planned.</p>

<p>Enjoying the pretty good weather, we first took time to admire the view across the Burrard Inlet at the dramatic snow covered mountains to the north. Then, we headed east, walking through Gastown with a short stop at its steam clock to watch it toot its steam on the quarter hour. As the area became seedier, we turned south, soon reaching the Chinatown gate.</p>

<p>We looked around at statues and signs about the Chinese in Canada, then entered Dr. Sun Yat-Sen Park. It didn't take long to stroll around and enjoy the classical Chinese garden, at the least the free part of the park. Another part required tickets for a tour. HaoFeng stopped by the Bank of Montreal to open an account, then we had some good Chinese noodles at Hon's Wun-Tun House.</p>

<p>After lunch, we took the Skytrain then the bus to reach Granville Island. Having just ate, we didn't go for the food at the public market, instead going to the waterfront to enjoy the view of False Creek and two bridges that span it. Our day passes let us use the ferry known as the SeaBus. So, for our next destination we took a bus to the SeaBus terminal at the Canadian Pacific Railway building. The ferry took us to North Vancouver's Lonsdale Quay, marked by a large, rotating &ldquo;Q.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Soon, we got on a bus headed for Lynn Valley. It felt like a long ride. I tried to look out for the signs for Lynn Canyon Park, but apparently missed them when the bus ended its route. We got off and walked a few blocks in light, steady rain until we entered the park. With it getting a bit late in the day and the light rain falling, we decided just to check out the suspension bridge spanning the lovely lush canyon.</p>

<p>After getting a few photos taken, we took the bus back to Lonsdale Quay and took the SeaBus to Vancouver. We then took a Skytrain to the Broadway Station and took a B-Line bus to the University of British Columbia. It took a long time and when we arrived we found we had to walk to the Museum of Anthropology. We ended up at the back of the building, where we encountered a sculpture garden of totem poles and a great view of the museum's Great Hall with its totem poles.</p>

<p>We soon found the main entrance to the museum and entered, taking advantage of the free Tuesday night admission. First, we took a good look at the impressive sculpture and totem poles of the Great Hall, then checked out the rest of the museum. We looked at an exhibit showing artifacts from islands in the South Pacific, then wandered through the massive collection in visible storage, showing much more than just First Nations art. Finally, we entered a separate area showcasing lovely ceramics.</p>

W<p>e exited and walked back to the bus stop, taking a B-Line bus back to Broadway Station. Then, we took a Skytrain to where we parked in Surrey. It took a bit of time to find my way by car to our hotel, the Holiday Inn Express, but we got there soon enough and checked in. We ate a quick, simple dinner with the help of HaoFeng's water heater, then showered and slept.</p>
