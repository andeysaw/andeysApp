<p>The train reached Bangkok by morning. It seemed to me that the air conditioning was turned up to make us cold, waking us up to disembark. Pathom, my maternal grandparents' driver, was there to pick us up and take us to the house. Once at my grandparents' place, I introduced my friends. We unpacked, relaxed a little, ate, then went out to explore Bangkok.</p>

<p>We first checked out the weekend market at Chutuchak. They seemed to sell almost everything, including military surplus items, handicrafts, clothes, food, pets, and more. They even had items possibly illegal in the United States for sale, including exotic animals! I bargained for a traditional Thai headdress to give later to my niece.</p>

<p>At night we went to the Mahboonkrong Shopping Centre, ate, and played some video games on the top floor. We then hung out a bit at a music store and a cyber cafe, where I sent out an email to my friend Linda while Alexander sent one to his mom. Next door was the Hard Rock Cafe and Planet Hollywood, but we didn't go inside. We were intrigued by the facade of the Hard Rock Cafe, which had a Tuk-Tuk sticking out of it. Done for the day, we went back to my grandparents' place to sleep.</p>
