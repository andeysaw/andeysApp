<p>When morning came, Joy mentioned to me that she did not sleep that well because our camp neighbors stayed up late talking and laughing. We managed to wake early anyway and got ready, packed and left. I saw morning rush hour in Albuquerque, but fortunately the heavy traffic went opposite of my direction.</p>

<p>Leaving the urban area behind, I continued on until I reached the Laguna Indian Reservation, where I exited I-40. As we drove the Indian road, we encountered bunches of cows, sheep and goats. Joy took some pictures as they crossed the road. We then entered the Acoma Indian Reservation, greeted by a good view of the huge Enchanted Mesa. Soon I could also see the next mesa and the town on top known as Sky City. We then stopped at the visitor center to park.</p>

<p>For $10 each we signed up for the tour of Sky City. Bringing my camera meant I paid an additional $10 for permission to take pictures. A shuttle bus arrived to take our group on the paved road up to the mesa. First, our guide led us to the San Esteban Del Rey Mission, completed in 1640. We saw the graveyard then stepped inside to find a sanctuary decorated with symbols of both Catholicism and the Acoma's native religion.</p>

<p>Back outside, the guide told us that the farther a dwelling was from the church, the older it happened to be. The youngest dwelling was only decades old, while the oldest reached back to around 1150. Occasionally, we stopped at little stands, where locals offered their arts, crafts and traditional food, including bread baked in their traditional ovens. We also were shown the only tree on the mesa, growing there only because of water next to it. Otherwise the mesa was bad for farming, so they had to do it below in surrounding lands.</p>

<p>At the end of the tour, we had a choice of either taking the shuttle bus back or walking down the mesa's stairs. Most of our group, including me and Joy, took the clearly marked, but sometimes steep rock steps to the bottom. We then walked back to our car at the visitor center parking lot and went on our way.</p>

<p>I must have missed the entrance to I-40 on my way northwest, but it did not matter anyway because I had already reached the intersection with Route 117. We headed south on it to El Malpais National Conservation Area, first stopping at the ranger station for information. Then, we headed south until we reached a scenic drive called The Narrows, where the road was flanked with high sandstone cliffs on one side and lava formations on the other. We turned back around when it ended and headed through the The Narrows again until we got to the parking lot for La Ventana Natural Arch.</p>

<p>From the car, we could already spot the arch, one of the largest ones in the state, but found that it blended in with the surrounding rock, so we hiked closer for a good look. In a short time, we found ourselves almost directly underneath the span where we had a dramatic view of it high above us, against the sky. After that, we headed north and onto a dirt road to check out the view of the lava flows from the Sandstone Bluffs Overlook in El Malpais National Monument.</p>

<p>Joy got in a little nap as we returned to I-40 just to exit quickly again on Route 53, heading to another section of El Malpais National Monument. We parked at the El Calderon Area and took our flashlights to explore a little bit of a lava tube cave known as Junction Cave. Balancing carefully on the rough rocks, we entered, going only as far as a little past the opening before turning back. I mainly had wanted Joy just to sample the interior of a lava tube cave.</p>

<p>We continued on Route 53 until we reached El Morro National Monument. After picking up a loaner guidebook from the visitor center, we walked the fairly short loop trail that went alongside the massive walls of Inscription Rock. Since ancient times, many people have passed by the pool of water at the base of the cliff, carving on the walls while there. Besides the petroglyphs, we saw many writings by Spanish explorers and colonizers, the oldest dating from 1605. English speaking settlers then later added their own marks as they journeyed past.</p>

<p>Returning to the car, we then continued west into the Zuni Indian Reservation, then north to Gallup to get on I-40. Soon, we entered Arizona and stopped at the rest area to make lunch. After that, we continued until we reached the exit for Petrified Forest National Park.</p>

<p>Already at our first viewpoint, Tiponi Point, the landscape was more interesting and colorful than what I had seen along I-40. I had heard all the points were worthwhile to see, so I stopped at all of them, though some did not change much from others. The stops got even more interesting as we continued on the park road south of the freeway. At Puerco Pueblo we saw ruins of a dwelling used from 1250 to 1380, then we saw some interesting pictographs just beyond it. Newspaper Rock, another stop, had incredible amounts of rock art, but we could only see them from afar, using scopes and my binoculars.</p>

<p>Soon, we entered a gorgeous area of colored, striped clay hills. Wanting to see even more, I decided we should visit the Blue Mesa area and hike the trail surrounded by this landscape. It was beautiful, but the low angle of the early evening light made it tough to take some good pictures. On the trail, we got our first look at the beauty of the park's petrified wood. We saw much more from near and far at Agate Bridge, Jasper Forest and Crystal Forest, but got to the Giant Logs trail too late, as it had just closed for the day.</p>

<p>After leaving the park, we browsed the selection at a shop that sold petrified wood legally collected outside the park. I ended up buying a small bag of colorful stones with my niece in mind. As a bonus, they gave me a small piece of petrified wood for free. We then drove US-180 until we reached Holbrook.</p>

<p>Out of curiousity, I stopped to take pictures of the Wigwam Village Motel, which had a collection of individual, conical shaped rooms with classic 1950s cars parked in front of them. When I found out that a wigwam was available, we decided to stay there after looking inside one. We finally relaxed for the day, eating some of our remaining food while watching cable television. We slept after taking showers.</p>
