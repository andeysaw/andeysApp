<p>We woke up a little more leisurely, packed our things and went to the motel office to drop off the room key and grab the complimentary breakfast. There wasn't much food left when we got there, but we found enough. After fueling up, we drive shortly to the nearby ghost town of Rhyolite and registered our visit at the house made of glass bottles. A woman working for the Bureau of Land Management greeted us and answered Ben's questions about the house. He also played with a couple kittens there who went after his breakfast bar.</p>

<p>We walked around the bottle house, then drove up to the old rail depot, which must have been a casino at some time too, judging by the faded sign on the building. From there, we visited some of the other ruins in the town, including the bank and the schoolhouse. Then, on our way out, we stopped to see the sculptures of the Goldwell Open Air Museum done by Belgian artists. They included a twisted metal one called &ldquo;Desert Flower,&rdquo; a ghostly interpretation of &ldquo;The Last Supper&rdquo; and a cinder block statue of a woman.</p>

<p>We made one more stop in the area, taking a little time to have a picture taken with the entrance sign to Death Valley National Park. We had a brief break at Stovepipe Wells then continued south and west, taking the Emigrant Canyon Rode to highway 178. In Ridgecrest, we stopped for a quick meal at Arby's and got fuel, then Ben took over the driving, taking us past Lake Isabella and through the Kern River Valley, which he really enjoyed.</p>

<p>Ben drove all the way to Kettleman City then let Arlene take over. A rock from the road hit the top of my windshield and caused a small crack. When we started going west on I-580, we noticed dark clouds. A check of the traffic and weather report on the radio mentioned heavy rain in the Bay Area, which soon hit us as we made our way to I-238 then I-880. We got to Ben and Arlene's place and soon I was heading north to home. I was worried about the growing crack on my windshield but made it home safely. It wasn't raining there. Finally done with the trip, I unpacked and relaxed.</p>
