<p>HaoFeng had a little problem getting to my place, but as soon as he did, we got his stuff into my car and we headed out within the timeframe we wanted to leave. I encountered rain on most of the drive, but nothing really hard. Snow surrounded the highest point of Interstate 5 at McKenzie Pass in southern Oregon, but we did not need to use tire chains there or anywhere else.</p>

<p>Evening fell as we bypassed Portland, continuing our long drive north. I was surprised that I did not need to take a significant break at any point. In Tacoma, I accidently exited onto Interstate 705, but then got back on and continued north. We bypassed Seattle and finally stopped in Bellingham, Washington, where we checked into the Shangri-La Downtown Motel.</p>

<p>The motel felt a bit run-down, but it sufficed and HaoFeng took advantage of the free local phone calls to dial onto the internet with his laptop computer. We ate a quick noodle dinner with HaoFeng's water heater, watched a little television, showered and slept.</p>
