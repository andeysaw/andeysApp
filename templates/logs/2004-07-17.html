<p>We woke up before sunrise this time and left the camp by around 6:30 AM for the somewhat long drive southwest to Oregon Caves National Monument. I encountered sprinkles of rain on Highway 62, but that ended fairly quickly. By about 9 AM we had made it up the winding Highway 46 to Oregon Caves and signed up for the next available tour at 9:15 AM, the second tour of the day.</p>

<p>As I expected for this time of day, we had a small tour group of only six, including our guide Robin. After an explanation of the minor hazards of the tour, with its uneven steps and low ceilings, we entered the cold cave. Robin showed us examples of many cave formations such as stalctites, stalagmites, columns, draperies, boxwork, moonmilk and cave popcorn. I remembered the &ldquo;Paradise Lost&rdquo; room from my last visit and it still was my favorite sight.</p>

<p>Our guide clearly showed an interest in bats and we heard extensively about them from her concerning their flight patterns, eating habits and misconceptions of them. Also, we talked about the history of the cave and saw historic graffiti and formations several decades ago. Near the end, we saw a covered display showing bear bones found in the cave.</p>

<p>After the cave tour, we took the short path back to the car and went for another somewhat long drive, this time north to Roseburg. I stopped at the Roseburg Visitor Center to pick up information about the Rogue-Umpqua Scenic Byway. We then stopped in Glide where I got better information about the byway from a ranger station. Also, we ate a quick lunch of canned foods near a view of the collision of the North Umpqua and Little Rivers.</p>

<p>We mainly focused on visiting the waterfalls of the scenic drive. At our first stop, we took a short, easy trail to Deadline Falls, which we found unimpressive. We did not stay long enough to see salmon jump the falls. A few miles drive east, we found and took the easy trail to lovely Susan Creek Falls. We turned back there, not visiting the Indian mounds beyond.</p>

<p>Driving a few more miles east, we arrived at the trailhead for Fall Creek Falls. I liked squeezing through a narrow rock crevice near the beginning of the trail. At the trail end, the cool breeze and mist from the waterfall relieved us from the warm, humid weather. I made a quick trip on a side trail to Job's Garden Geological Area out of curiousity, but didn't find anything of great interest there.</p>

<p>A detour from the main road onto Road 38 then up road 3810 led us to Steamboat Falls Campground. With permission from a lady in the campground, we passed through her site to take a look at Steamboat Falls. Back on the main byway and about twenty miles east, we found the trailhead for Toketee Falls, one of the waterfalls I looked forward to see. The trail ended at a boardwalk overlook with a great view of the dramatic waterfall cutting through columnar basalt.</p>

<p>Not far east up the road, we hit the trail for Watson Falls, which offered a steeper climb but also a more scenic one that mostly followed a creek. At a footbridge near the end, I got a really good view of the majestic, tall waterfall dropping down a steep cliff. I climbed a little further to the upper viewpoint for a closer, side view of the fall. Joy and Alex, hiking slower, joined me a few minutes later. We then returned on a return loop to the car.</p>

<p>A few miles east, we reached Whitehorse Falls Campground, where we parked for a quick look at Whitehorse Falls, not impressive at all after seeing the last two falls. Then, up the road at Clearwater Falls Campground, we visited the waterfall there in the fading light of day, swatting the mosquitoes that had emerged for the evening. I ran out of battery power in my camera right there and had to swat flies while putting in new batteries.</p>

<p>We made no more stops on the scenic byway, but looked to our right to peak between the many trees at Diamond Lake as we headed to the north entrance of Crater Lake National Park. Once in the park, I drove the road west of the lake, stopping once to take picture of the sun setting. After taking showers at Mazama Village, we ate a dinner of pasta with sauce, then went to sleep.</p>
