<p>I woke up early again and waited patiently until everybody was up. We made and ate breakfast and slowly, they all got ready for the day. My sister wanted to rest for the first part of the day and let me use her car to take the kids somewhere not too far away, so I decided to take them on the Mt. Baker Scenic Byway to do short hikes at Heather Meadows in the Mt. Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest.</p>

<p>I set out with them only to return to get my camera. On the road again, we headed up the mountain road, seeing clouds high up ahead. When we got to the Heather Meadows Visitor Center, I saw, to my disappointment, plenty of low clouds and drizzle. We went inside for a visit, reading some of the displays and occasionally stopping by the fire to warm ourselves up. I obtained information about short hikes in the area.</p>

<p>Despite the cold, wet weather, Ariana and Liam still wanted to do some walking. So, we started with the Fire and Ice Trail near the visitor center. The drizzle stopped and we started enjoying the hike, taking time to read each panel on the trail. Despite the clouds, we perceived some dramatic mountain scenery. At least we clearly saw the lakes and ponds in Heather Meadows and found them fairly scenic.</p>

<p>We drove off to the highest place on the scenic byway, Artist Point. The road ended at the parking lot there, elevation 5100 feet. The drizzle increased up there, but we went ahead and did a short hike up the Artist Ridge Trail. We had glimpses of glaciers on rugged slopes, making me wonder if I had seen part of Mt. Baker. When we finally started driving back down the road, we made quick stops to look at a ski lift and then a big building with a dramatic mountain backdrop.</p>

<p>Not far from Glacier, we pulled onto a short gravel road that led us to a point overlooking Nooksack Falls. When we reached the condo, my sister and Billy were ready to leave for Nooksack River Casino by themselves. They wanted to win back the money they lost two days earlier. After they went, I watched a DVD movie with my niece and nephew. Then, we went outside to look at the Recreation Building, but they ended up enjoying playing in the fallen leaves.</p>

<p>We went back inside the condo to watch another movie on the laptop computer and to just play around indoors. Much later, my sister and Billy came back, upset at having lost more money at the casino. We then spent our time figuring out our plans for the next couple days and went over to the Recreation Center to look inside. We found a TV room, pool room, racquetball court and swimming pool. After looking around there, we went back to the condo to sleep.</p>
