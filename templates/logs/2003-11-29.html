<p>I woke up to a morning that felt colder than any other one on the trip. The frozen bottle of water Songyuan left outside overnight confirmed the freezing temperatures. Songyuan took the tent down and I got the water boiling for hot chocolate. Pouring some into my cup, I spilled a little and watched as it turned into ice on the surface of the picnic table.</p>

<p>After getting ready, we took the short drive to the Wire Pass trailhead and began our hike to The Wave. I led the way, knowing the unmarked route from before, stopping for Songyuan to take pictures of the beautiful landscape. I took a few myself. We reached The Wave in an hour and a half, ahead of a group of four others we had passed. Both of us had fun taking pictures there and at The Swirls. I had more time than on my last visit, so I explored much more of the area. I also got pictures of The Wave from a point above it.</p>

<p>After enjoying the incredible landscape and taking many pictures, Songyuan noted that we had spent an hour and a half there. Slowly, we made our way out, taking a few last pictures of the place. We pretty much went back on the path that we came, though I did not know exactly which pass to go over, but soon found out just by looking down from the top. Back at the car, we took off to the highway, eating lunch on the drive out.</p>

<p>We passed Kanab and then headed to Zion National Park. I stopped at the viewpoint for the Checkerboard Mesa for Songyuan to take pictures, then we went to the Zion-Mount Carmel Tunnel. After having to wait in line with other cars, we went through the old tunnel. I pointed out to Songyuan the windows that would occasionally appear, giving us a glimpse of grand scenery.</p>

<p>With little daytime to see the park, we only made a stop at the visitor center. A lovely video display on the wall showed scenes visible from day hikes in the canyon. Songyuan got a stamp in his park passport book and we watched a video about the geology of the park. Outside the building we lingered at the views of the cliffs, then finally returned to the car.</p>

<p>As light faded, we left the park and made our way to I-15. For Songyuan, I pointed out the shining white Mormon temple in St. George and the wildlife museum I visited on my last trip to the city. Daylight mostly faded by the time we drove the winding highway through the Virgin River Gorge. Just as I tired from driving, we reached North Las Vegas, where we left the highway for the road to Lake Mead National Recreation Area. The bright lights of the city disappeared quickly when we went over a pass.</p>

<p>We drove through an area dark enough to need high beams for good visibility, but I could still see the glow from the city of Las Vegas, particularly noticing the beam from the Luxor Hotel and Casino. We arrived at the campground in Las Vegas Bay, found a spot to set up our tent and registered our campsite. After eating a simple dinner of soup with noodles, we went to sleep.</p>
