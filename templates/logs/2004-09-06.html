<p>After waking up, we packed our bags and headed downstairs to the Blue Room for the TPAA Farewell Breakfast. While eating there, I chatted with a young woman who I found out is releasing an album of songs she sings, written by the king of Thailand. When filled up, we checked out of the hotel and went on our way out of New Orleans. I decided to take the Lake Pontchartrain Causeway out, to see what the longest bridge in the world felt like to drive.</p>

<p>I enjoyed the scenery of the lake as I started crossing the twenty-four mile bridge. Occasionally, I looked in the rear view mirror to see the south shore getting smaller. By the time I reached the bascule drawbridge in the middle, I could no longer clearly see any land in any direction. Soon after that, though, I saw the north shore. When we reached Interstate 12, we stopped at a rest area for my dad, where I saw many insects flying around.</p>

<p>I did most of the driving through the state of Mississippi. My dad did the bit that took us through Jackson. Right after the capital city, we made a stop in Madison to eat at Burger King, at my moms request. A long time later, we reached the city of Memphis in Tennessee. I got off the highway to the Memphis Visitor Center, where I took pictures of my parents with the statue of Elvis Presley, at my dads request.</p>

<p>We soon returned to the road, driving through Arkansas and into Missouri. Dinner time came around and we decided to eat, so we stopped in Cape Girardeau. First, I looked for a Chinese restaurant, but we ended up eating pizza at Papa John's. A lovely bridge over the Mississippi River took us into Illinois, and I drove until we reached Wal-Mart in Carbondale, where they shopped for groceries. Finally, we made it home after that.</p>
