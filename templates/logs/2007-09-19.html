<p>I ended up starting the day earlier than I planned, so I took advantage of the extra time. I ate an egg and cheese croissant at Fluffy's Cafe and Bakery then continued north into Central Park. Some of the homeless there still slept as I made my way to the Literary Walk. I stopped at each statue of a particular writer such as Sir Walter Scott as I continued northward. I ended up at the Bethesda Terrace, which had a circular fountain by a lake.</p>

<p>After a look at a map, I found my way to Strawberry Fields to see the circle with the word &ldquo;Imagine&rdquo; in the middle. Someone had placed rose petals on it in the shape of a peace symbol. From there, I walked to Conservatory Water to see people play with their model boats on the water. A statue of Hans Christian Anderson sat in view of the pond. I next passed through the wooded Ramble to reach Belvedere Castle for views of Turtle Pond and Delacorte Theater.</p>

<p>Summit Rock was the highest point in Central Park, but I found the view disappointing. When I reached the Great Lawn, I got a good view of the buildings at the edge of Midtown. I skirted the Reservoir counter-clockwise on the southeast side until I found an exit where I then made my way to the Guggenheim Museum. Unfortunately, the museum's stylish exterior was covered in scaffolding. At least I could take photos of the interior view.</p>

<p>Because of changing exhibits, only about half the museum had areas open to the public. I first took the elevator up to the top floor to see the abstract paintings by Richard Pousette-Dart, which I found unimpressive. Slowly, I made my way down, checking out all of the modern art, then got a postcard at the gift shop. I next hopped onto the subway until I got to the Museum of Modern Art.</p>

<p>Feeling hungry, I bought a beef pouch from a street cart and ate next to an outdoor sculpture. When done, I entered the museum and picked up a free self-guided audio tour kit. First, I wandered the outdoor sculpture garden, especially going inside Richard Serra's massive curved steel structures. Back indoors, I started exploring from the top, taking photos of interesting or featured artworks, many of them by famous artists.</p>

<p>A couple of rooms showcased modern design such as architectural elements and furniture and another had photographs of Soviet Modernist Arhitecture. Richard Serra also had sculptures in one of the large first floor galleries. I followed the contiguous vertical surfaces around each installation that led me in and out of the interiors, giving me different visual perspectives. After making sure that I saw every exhibit, I took the subway until I reached Greenwich Village.</p>

<p>I looked around at buildings then entered Washington Square Park. The busy park had chess players, a couple bands and many people just enjoying the pleasant day. I made sure to stop at the fountain and the large arch before heading south through New York University to SoHo, where I walked down Greene Street to look at the cast iron architecture. Eventually, I reached an impressive police station then continued to Mulberry Street for the Feast of San Gennaro.</p>

<p>I ambled up and down the street to see what the festival offered, noting a shrine to Saint Gennaro with money attached to it. I continued south to Chinatown, where I saw a large gathering of Chinese in Columbus Park. I turned back north after I reached a Chinese gate then returned through the Bloody Angle, a place once known for its surprise gang attacks. I passed a small Buddhist temple before re-entering Little Italy.</p>

<p>I bought dinner from street venders, eating sausage and peppers followed by a cream cannoli calzone and mint chocolate ice cream, then explored the small grounds of the Most Precious Blood Church. I entered through the back and unexpectedly found myself near the front of a crowded congregation during a ceremony, so quickly left. I stayed just outside to watch people while waiting for the scheduled procession of a Saint Gennaro statue.</p>

<p>A huge crowd followed as the statue emerged. I had a great vantage point as one guy attached a $50 bill to the statue. I followed the procession a bit then escaped to a quiet street for a break. Upon returning, I watched Opera Night. After a tribute to Luciano Pavarotti, I heard local contest winners sing as well as a man from Italy. One woman injected a Broadway tune. When the performances ended, I took the subway back to Pat's place to sleep.</p>
