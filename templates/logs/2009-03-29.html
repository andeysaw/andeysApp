<p>I packed my rolling bag and left Aspen Hill, taking the Metro bus and then rail until I got to the city of Alexandria in Virginia. I then took the DASH to Old Town. Because few places were open at that time, I just wandering around rolling my luggage looking at historic places associated with George Washington and Robert E. Lee such as the Carlyle House, a replica of George Washington's townhouse, the boyhood home of Robert E. Lee, and Christ Church.</p>

<p>I also stopped at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier of the American Revolution and then walked to the waterfront. Done with old town, I took the King Street Trolley to the George Washington National Masonic Memorial, which had a good view of more modern Alexandria. Inside, I looked at all the stuff the memorial had on George Washington and the Masons, including an exhibit on the Shriners Hospitals. There was no tour to the top of the tower though.</p>

<p>My friend Isaiah picked me up when I finished and took me to a small eatery in Old Town called Jack's Place where I had a sandwich called &ldquo;The Breakfast Usual.&rdquo; He pointed out to me an elk statue and the narrowest house in town as we left the area and drove onto the scenic George Washington Memorial Parkway, heading to the National Air and Space Museum Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center.</p>

<p>At the museum, we first went up the tower where we could watch activity at Dulles airport and see air traffic control exhibits. Then, we looked the space shuttle Enterprise as well as other space vehicles and satellites. The cavernous hangar held many interesting aircraft, including the Boeing B-29 Superfortress Enola Gay that dropped a nuclear bomb on Japan, an Air France Concorde, a Virgin Atlantic Global Flyer, and a Lockheed Sr-71A Blackbird.</p>

<p>We left the museum just before it closed and went a few miles away for dinner at Bonefish Grill. I ate salmon with garlic whipped potatoes and corn chowder with crab. We then went to Dulles airport and I said goodbye to Isaiah. I had time to walk around a little bit and then departed on  Virgin America Flight 77. I used a free voucher I got to watch <em>Slumdog Millionaire.</em> When my flight arrived in San Francisco, I took the Radisson shuttle back to Sierra Point to get my car and go home.</p>
