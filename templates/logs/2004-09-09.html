<p>In the wee hours of the morning, we made a fuel stop in Sacramento. Billy and I continued switching driving. Then, when dawn broke around Redding, my sister started to drive. Light arrived in time for us to enjoy a bit of the Northern California scenery, including Lake Shasta and Mount Shasta. After anticipating it for what seemed a long time, we finally made the crossing into Oregon.</p>

<p>We exited in Medford and started noticing a problem with the back passenger side tire. It needed proper reinstalling, so we took it to Tires Les Schwab to fix it. While waiting, we walked over to Spicers and had a sizeable breakfast. We had some more waiting after breakfast, but could see workers not taking their time. Finally, we got on our way, stopping a bit later for an adjustment at the Tires Les Schwab in Grants Pass.</p>

<p>Back on the long drive, we continued north, descending into the Willamette Valley. In Salem, we bought some food at McDonalds. When we arrived in the Portland Metro Area, we quickly got slowed by heavy traffic. Relief finally came when we reached the Travelodge in Troutdale. After checking in, everybody cleaned up and rested. I felt pretty tired, but decided I had enough energy to go out for a bit.</p>

<p>Billy wanted the car washed, so Ariana and I went to a nearby one, where we did some vacuuming. We then went through an automatic wash. Ariana was excited and a bit scared, not having been inside one before. With daylight left, we decided to take a short drive to visit the Columbia River Gorge. We tried a bit of the scenic drive, then decided to go directly to Multnomah Falls. We stopped at Wahkeena Falls before we got back to the hotel.</p>

<p>My sister and the rest of her family were outside already when we showed up and we immediately went out to eat dinner at the Typhoon Thai Restaurant in Gresham. I thought the food tasted pretty good and we had a friendly waiter. We walked the shopping area a little bit after eating, then headed to downtown Portland just to drive around. Unfortunately, an accident made traffic on the Fremont Bridge sluggish, delaying our return to the hotel. Once we got there, we slept.</p>
