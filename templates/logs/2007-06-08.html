<p>We woke up and got ready for another day with a shore excursion. My brother and I went up to Islands Caf&eacute; for a quick breakfast and a look at the views of Helsinki. Then we disembarked and took the shuttle into the city. It took me a little bit of time to orient myself after being dropped off. We ended up strolling through Esplanade Park, checking out the statues, including a long line of Reina Mariana statues lined up in order of size.</p>

<p>We returned through Esplanade Park again to go find the Mannerheim museum and ended up getting views of the city from Observatory Hill and passing two cruise-ship sized ferries. Finally, after studying the not-so-detailed map in my Lonely Planet Scandinavia book, I found the Mannerheim museum, which was a two-story house in a quiet neighborhood. I stepped in and payed admission, then we put plastic covers on our shoes to protect the floor.</p>

<p>My brother and I joined an English-speaking tour in progress, about to go to the upper floor. From the parlor room filled with artifacts from his wordly travels, we ascended the stairs. We saw many photos and items such as Mannerheim's medals and uniforms while the guide told us about the guy's many accomplishments as a politician, military leader and world traveler. Downstairs had many family portraits and a huge tiger skin.</p>

<p>For lunch, my brother and I went to Vanha Kauppahall, a market hall with a variety of food laid out in glass display cases. We both bought a small lunch of fish and shrimp on flat bread and ate while heading back to the shuttle bus point. Not long after the shuttle returned us to the ship, I boarded a tour bus for our pre-planned excurson. Our guide talked about Finnish culture and pointed out sights along the way to the Rock Church Temppleiaukio.</p>

<p>The church indeed had a large wall of natural rock around it and was capped with a big copper dome. A cross cut out of a metal rectangle marked the simple rectangular entrance. We entered into a short hallway that led to a large, open room lighted naturally through slits surrounding the copper dome. The interior of the Lutheran church had a simple altar, organ pipes and a votive candles area. My brother and I found stairs that led a higher view of the place.</p>

<p>After leaving the church, our tour bus whisked us northwest to the edge of town. On the way, we glimpsed a large art installation consisting of vertical pipes connected together, known as the Sibelius Monument. Then, we reached the quiet parking area for the Seurasaari Open-Air Museum. The bus parked, we got an orientation, then walked on a long, white footbridge to the museum situated on a section of Seurasaari Island.</p>

<p>After a group check-in, we each received maps of the outdoor museum set up to display traditional Finnish rural life. Our guide briefly explained each small building, but I paid more attention to looking around. We entered the Niemel&auml; Tenant Farm and found a couple young women acting the part of farm workers. We chatted with them then continued on to the Karuna Church, touring its simple interior. Outside stood two fake graves and one real one.</p>

<p>For our final stop, we visited the Antti Farmstead, seeing another collection of modestly furnished buildings representing rural life. The tour group then gathered together at indoor tables where we got served a choice of teas. We relaxed there for a while then started back to the foot bridge and the bus. The tour guide continued to narrate as we headed to our final stop, Senate Square, where we had a set time to freely roam.</p>

<p>Immediately, everyone felt drawn to the imposing Cathedral of Helsinki set at the top of a steep set of stairs. Most of us headed up to enter the grand structure and look around. While exploring, my brother and I found a small lift that ended up taking us into a crypt that contained an art gallery. We exited to the street then got back up to the top of the steps for a good view. We boarded the bus soon after and it returned us to the ship.</p>

<p>Back in our cabin, we got dressed for a formal night, then headed for the Grand Restaurant for the five-course dinner. My brother, Alisa and I later got together at the cinema to watch the movie <em>Ms Henderson Presents,</em> which passed the time well. After watching the sun slowly set, I went back to the cabin to get ready for an early start, double checking that I had what I needed for a full day in St. Petersburg.</p>
