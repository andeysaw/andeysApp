<p>I woke up early despite the time zone adjustment I had to make, got ready and then had oatmeal in the kitchen, sitting with one of the residents sharing the house, an old Chinese guy. I then headed out into the cold morning and walked to the bus stop where I caught the Y8 going all the way to Silver Spring. From there, I took a quick photo of Discovery Communication's headquarters and hopped onto the Metrorail, passing through D.C. and into Fairfax County, Virginia.</p>

<p>Fairfax Connector 151 got me to Mount Vernon Estate, where I disembarked and paid to enter the grounds. I headed straight for George Washington's estate but found a long line of student groups there. After a little wait and inquiry to one of the chaperones, I went back to the Ford Orientation Center to watch the introductory film on George Washington. When I returned to the estate, I found the line had gotten significantly shorter now that the students had gone through.</p>

<p>Despite a smaller line, I still felt like a part of an assembly line as I shuffled through the rooms while members of the Mount Vernon Ladies' Association described the rooms they stood in and repeated the info over and over. I thought the attraction could make use of an automated audio tour system. The tour route took me to various rooms in two of the floors where I saw many paintings, period furniture and, notably, a key of the Bastille prison.</p>

<p>When done with the tour, I took in the view of the Potomac River and then headed to the Reynolds Museum and Education Center. I saw school kids crowding the education center, so first I entered the quiet museum with its collection of belongings from the Washington family. A video told the story of the creation of the Houdon Bust of Washington featured at the entrance. At the end, I saw a special exhibit about Washington's generals showing artifacts from them.</p>

<p>The education center had become less crowded, so I checked out the interactive multimedia exhibits that chronicled many aspects of the life of George Washington. The guy certainly did a lot more than be the first president and in fact saw himself most as a farmer. A theater with effects such as fake snow falling showed a film about decisive Revolutionary War battles. A passage from the education center led me past photos of the restoration of Mount Vernon to the food court, where I ate a turkey club sandwich at Capital City Deli.</p>

<p>I returned to the grounds of the estate to explore the outbuildings including the slave quarters, overseer's quarters, clerk's quarters, smoke house, coach house and stables. Also around there, I saw various gardens and some newborn lambs. I also saw the former and current tombs of George and Martha Washington. A short walk from the tombs stood a memorial to the slaves that lived and worked at Mount Vernon. Down the hill, I stopped at the wharf along the river and then checked out the Pioneer Farmer Site.</p>

<p>After visiting the 16-sided barn and a slave cabin, I took the short Forest Trail through the woods back uphill to pens that held cattle and pigs. I continued until I got to the gift shop near the entrance of the grounds where I bought a couple postcards. I then checked the bus schedule and rushed out just in time to get one back to the Huntington Metrorail Station. With time to spare, I decided to go to the Pentagon stop to see the memorial there that I found out about the day before.</p>

<p>Upon exiting the Metrorail Station, I noticed signs prohibiting photography. Fortunately, I could take pictures when I got to the memorial site, reached by a short walk around the Pentagon. The memorial consisted of a field of low, curved benches with inscriptions of those who perished at there on September 11, 2001. Individual pools of water ran under each bench and a surrounding wall had years inscribed on them representing birthyears.</p>

<p>About a dozen or so people stood around, some looking somber and others just trying to get good pictures. I wandered the grounds for a while looking at engraved names and then returned to the Metrorail Station, stopping briefly to look at a Pentagon shaped bird house. From there, I took the Blue Line to the Federal Triangle and then walked over to the Old Post Office. I found that I got in pretty close to the closing time when I made it to the bell tower.</p>

<p>I had the view all to myself, looking out through wire curtains to the major federal buildings, including a look down and across to the FBI building next door. I then descended to the inscribed bells and then to the room with the bell ringer cords. Back outside, I looked at the buildings around Woodrow Wilson Plaza before entering the Metrorail. I returned to Aspen Hill where I bought groceries and a microwave dinner. I talked to my sister on the phone, showered, wrote postcards and then slept.</p>
