<p>The only part of the trip I dreaded was the long drive, which I would have to do entirely on my own as my brother was too young to drive. I tried to keep him involved by helping me figure out just how long it would take to go from city to city. It always seemed like it would take one hour to go to our next goal. Whenever I saw a lone house in the middle of the high desert, I asked myself, &ldquo;Who lives in such isolation?&rdquo; I'm sure it's mostly ranchers.</p>

<p>The drive finally became more interesting as we entered Idaho, because the weather had changed. We saw massive thunderclouds in the distance and watched them as they constantly discharged lightning. I am not used to seeing that where I live. Fortunately, we never directly dealt with those storms. After thirteen hours of driving, we finally reached our first campsite at Craters of the Moon National Monument.</p>
