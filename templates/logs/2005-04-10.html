<p>I woke up when I heard Pui use her computer, but didn't get up until later. Tom slept in as expected, so I slowly got ready for the morning then spent my time there much like yesterday. I had eggs, bacon and toast for breakfast and also took time to share my recent photographs with Mrs. Wenzel, who in turn shared her pictures from her trip to South Africa. Later, Pui wanted me to play World of Warcraft, so I did until we left for Lake Tahoe.</p>

<p>Because I would not return to Minden that day, I followed Pui and Tom's Mustang with my car as we made our way up to Heavenly Village in South Lake Tahoe. Fortunately, we did not need chains and had great weather. After paying for the expensive gondola ticket, we took one up, sharing it with a younger guy named Michael nicknamed &ldquo;Juiceman&rdquo; by Pui for spilling a little orange juice on himself and Tom. We left him at mid-point station, where we got out to enjoy a great view of Lake Tahoe. Pui and Tom got some hot chocolate for themselves.</p>

<p>Back in the gondola, we continued to the end and headed for the Adventure Peak office that handled rentals for various snow activities other than downhill skiing and snowboarding, such as snow bikes and cross-country skis. We rented snowshoes, put them on and soon found ourselves out in the snow heading for the nearest uphill. We headed away from the ski runs and lifts, enjoying being in the midst of the forest with relatively unbroken snow. Up we went, focusing on the highest point in our view.</p>

<p>After a good amount of exercise, we finally bagged a peak which had a great view of Lake Tahoe as well as mountain ranges in Nevada. Pui noted the Chucker Hills down below near the Wenzel's house. We enjoyed the view for a while, taking pictures, then went down a little bit different way then before. We had a few minor challenges of getting down steep slopes, but got through without problems. It took us far less time to get back to the rental shop then we expected, but we felt we had accomplished something and returned our gear a little early.</p>

<p>We enjoyed the great view as we descended on the gondola back to Heavenly Village. At the bottom, Pui went across to another shopping plaza while we drove our cars from the expensive parking lot to the free, limited time lot to meet her. There, we headed for Baja Fresh to eat Mexican food for lunch. With no more sightseeing in mind for the day, I parted with them when finished eating and headed back home, only stopping for fuel in Folsom.</p>
