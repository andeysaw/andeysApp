<p>Even with the change to Mountain Daylight Time, we managed to get up at 4 AM and leave the campground by 5 AM. When we left the freeway, we hit heavy traffic headed to the International Balloon Fiesta. Once at the parking lot, we got guided to a parking spot, bought entry tickets and proceeded through one of the gates. We walked down the field in darkness until we found balloons being inflated as part of the Dawn Patrol, lighting up dramatically by fire.</p>

<p>The few balloons of the Dawn Patrol rapidly ascended and floated away, twinkling as their burners turned on and off. Then, Darth Vader, his storm troopers and bounty hunters from the Star Wars franchise showed up. Many spectators took pictures with and of them as they prepared to inflate the Darth Vader helmet balloon. As dawn broke, I could see other teams readying their balloons. Joey and I left to explore other vantage points while Pui and Craig stuck by Vader.</p>

<p>The launch field held hundreds of hot air balloons getting ready for mass ascension. I vigilently looked all around me, snapping pictures of unique designs and shapes. Notable shapes included a cow, a fish, Darth Vader's helmet, a stagecoach, a mug of beer, a ladybug, a cathedral and a dragon. Near the end two large bee balloons launched together holding hands that later separated. An announcer spoke throughout the show.</p>

<p>Joey and I ended up staying in one place during mass ascension and then sought Pui and Craig afterwards. We found them relaxing on the lawn and joined them while watching chase vehicles return with their balloons. We then checked out the festival main street, starting with a chainsaw wood carving competition with large sculptures quickly taking shape. Pui liked the truck giving out spam with coupons. Craig and Joey found souvenirs to buy.</p>

<p>Next to the launch field stood the International Balloon Museum. We browsed the gift shop but decided not to spend time and money for the exhibits. Instead, we returned to our truck and drove to Old Town Albuquerque. After we found parking, we headed for Church Street Cafe. While waiting for a table, I went next door to get a magnet free with a coupon and gave it to Pui. We then got an interior table and I had the Pollo de Ruiz with Lemon Tea.</p>

<p>I enjoyed my meal but Craig and Pui did not like theirs. When we finished, I went to another shop to get turquoise earrings free with coupon that I gave to Pui. We wandered other shops as well as San Felipe de Neri Church, oldest building in the city. Meanwhile, a mariache band played in a park gazebo. We then left for the quieter sculpture garden of the Albuquerque Museum of Art and History that turned out to be quite extensive.</p>

<p>After looking at many modern sculptures, we found ourselves in a quiet, pretty alley where we visited a photo gallery. Done with sightseeing for the day, we then shopped for supplies. Craig picked up something at REI which had a sale going on. We then got fuel and more stuff at Walgreens before returning to camp. We found Craig's tent in bad shape as winds began whipping through the campsite. He ended up taking it down.</p>

<p>The storm intensified, so we just relaxed in the car for a while. Joey and I decided to cook dinner on our stoves when the wind died down. At that time, Pui and Craig decided to drive off to eat out. They ended up at KFC after deeming the nearby casino too smoky. Meanwhile, Joey and I ate quickly and then took turns using the shower. Rain began during this time. When they returned, Pui and Craig set up to sleep in the truck while I retreated to my small tent.</p>
