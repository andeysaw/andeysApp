<p>Everyone got ready much earlier than I originally expected. We were all eager to go explore after already being impressed with the view outside the door of Cascade Mountain. Outside in the chilly morning air, we got into the car and drive up Tunnel Mountain Road to the first viewpoint, which I found unmarked. After a short walk, we look out to see a small set of hoodoos within a beautiful setting that included the Bow River and Mount Rundle. We then left, continuing on the road towards downtown Banff until we reached the Banff Springs Hotel.</p>

<p>We parked nearby the impressive hotel and walked into the lobby to look around. At this point, after visiting the washrooms, we lost track of Peggy. When we found her again, she led us to a great view in the back of the building of snowy mountains. We took some pictures then returned to the car to go to the Banff Information Centre, which finally opened for the day. Mainly, I got information there on the best places to see autumn colors. &ldquo;Everywhere&rdquo; was the first answer I heard, then we got into specifics.</p>

<p>Leaving the townsite, we soon reached the Bow Valley Parkway's southern entrance off of the Trans-Canada. Pretty soon, we spotted some bighorn sheep along the road. We stopped at most of the viewpoints, each time admiring the steep, angular mountains and the gold leaves of the trembling aspens. At Muleshoe, we watched a train of the Canadian Pacific Railway reflect in the Bow River as it passed. We then parked the car at the entrance to Johnston Canyon for our first hike of the trip.</p>

<p>Not long after entering the canyon, the walls narrowed quickly and the trail turned into a catwalk attached to the cliff. After a little over a kilometer, we reached Lower Falls. A short spur trail bridged over to the other side of the canyon then through a natural tunnel that for a rather close, wet encounter with the waterfall. The main trail continued up the canyon, sometimes as a catwalk and sometimes as a regular dirt trail. It passed a few small waterfalls and cascades. We turned around after viewing the Upper Falls at the end of a catwalk spur of the trail.</p>

<p>After eating lunch at a picnic table by the parking lot, we continued on the Bow Valley Parkway, pausing to admire such great sights such as Pilot Mountain and Castle Mountain. On the return to Banff Townsite on the Trans-Canada, we made one more stop to get in a grand view of Mount Rundle and its neighbors such as Sulphur Mountain and Mount Howard-Douglas. We then entered town to take the Banff Gondola that went up Sulphur Mountain.</p>

<p>After photos with the Brewster Ice Explorer in the parking lot, I bought tickets and we headed up on the gondola, enjoyed great views of the Bow Valley and its surrounding mountains. At first, I felt cold and windy at the top, but the weather warmed up a bit soon after. We took a boardwalk path that led us to the top of Sanson Peak, which had an historic weather observatory on top with wonderful views in all directions. Signs indicated the location of a Cosmic Ray Station that existed there.</p>

<p>With some extra time remaining back down at the parking lot, we proceeded to the Cave and Basin National Historic Site, known as the birthplace of Canada's National Park system. We noticed the sulphur smell soon after entering the grounds. First, we headed right for the cave and its smelly pool. Then, we checked out the basin and its greenish sulphuric pool. A small theater next to it showed a film about the history of the place. It appeared to have been produced in the 1980s.</p>

<p>We wandered a bit more on the grounds, briefly checking out the upstairs exhibits and informatino about the endangered Banff Springs Snail. Finally, we went on the Discovery Boardwalk to look at a couple springs. When done, we went back to the condo to cook and eat dinner. Then, we went back to town to walk around and shop and get more needed groceries. Back at the condo, I wrote a couple postcards and then went to sleep.</p>
