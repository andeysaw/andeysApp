<p>We got up, got ready and broke camp, then left the park, heading to Spring Green. On the way to The House On The Rock, we stopped at a roadside view where we could see a far view of it and its long, unsupported Infinity Room sticking out like a blade. We then drove to the parking lot of the house museum and went down a winding garden path to the entrance.</p>

<p>Before the ticket booth, we already got a taste of the extensive decoration of the complex when we saw displays in the orienation room and the men's restroom. We paid admission, then walked down the path to The Gate House. Inside, we found small, dimly lit rooms in an unusual arrangement with mellow sounds playing. An elevated passageway led us from that place to The House On The Rock, the original attraction.</p>

<p>We found the ceiling quite low, with carpet on some of it to protect visitors. Just standing in some places, I could touch it with my hair. First, we headed to the Infinity Room and walked to the end, where a glass table and floor allowed us to look down 156 feet to the Wyoming Valley. Then, we toured the rest of the dimly lit three story house, with its eclectic collection of Asian art and stained glass lamps. After checking out the view from the roof, we left the unique house, passing a sitting place not for those afraid of heights.</p>

<p>We visited the Mill House next and found a beautiful collection of paper weights among other collections. We also saw a greater proliferation of mechanical music machines than earlier, ready to accept tokens to play. Not wanting to spend much more money in the place, we heard songs from machines whenever others put in tokens. The Streets of Yesterday, followed, with its false store fronts basically an excuse to hold more collections. I did not find much of interest except for a huge calliope at the end.</p>

<p>The huge Heritage of the Sea room contained a 200 foot model of a sea creature resembling the fictional Moby Dick, larger than any real whale. Around it, a ramp hugging the walls led upwards past displays of ship models along with real nautical artifacts. In the corridor between that room and the Pizza Atrium, we saw displays of Christmas related items.</p>

<p>Between the atrium and Rozino's Pizza, we saw the Transportation Building, which had a small collection of automobiles and had walls lined with bicycles. A sign next to the seemingly broken Rube Goldberg machine told us we had just gone halfway through two and a half miles of exhibits. Then, at the bottom of the ramp we descended, we read some amusing Burma Shave signs on the wall.</p>

<p>We passed through the Music of Yesterday next, with more token operated mechanical music machines. A little side room called Spirit of Aviation had newspapers as wallpaper and model airplanes hanging from the ceiling. Continuing on, we got directed into a large glittery room with what the guide pamphlet claimed was the world's largest carousel. Indeed, it was impressive and had various animals except horses. No one was allowed to ride the machine.</p>

<p>Going through a tunnel with an entrance shaped like a monster's mouth, we entered the strange Organ Room. The room had organ pipes built into the walls. We could see slots open and close as notes played. We also saw elaborate organ consoles, big, unusual chandeliers and an assortment of electrical equipment. Past that room we saw a large collection of doll houses.</p>

<p>Getting tired, we more quickly passed through exhibits in the Circus Room, Weapons Exhibit, Oriental Collection, Armor Collection and the Crown Jewel Collection. The last room housed doll carousels, which rotated with dolls in each niche. We climbed the ramp around them and exited to the gift shop. We then went back to car to eat lunch before taking off. We drove past Madison, then stopped at a visitor center just past the border into Illinois for information.</p>

<p>My brother drove as we entered the city of Chicago and got worn down by the traffic. Some drivers appeared to expect us to start moving just before the lights turned green, honking if we didn't. We found a parking garage near the Art Institute of Chicago and parked there to visit the museum, open late that day with free admission thanks to Ford Motor Company.</p>

<p>We visited most of the museum, taking more time at whatever caught our interest more. In particular, we loved the detailed Thorne Miniature Rooms, showing main rooms of different periods of time in different parts of the world. We also dwelled in an exhibit of daguerreotype images that used magnifiers to allow us good view of the details of the small plates. We saw how the daguerreotypes were used to record peoples lives around the 1850s. I found a unique print inside a sphere, that captured an image of the area that had been around it at picture time.</p>

<p>We had to hurry a bit more in the rest of the exhibits that we assigned lower priority to see. Close to closing time, we checked out a bit of the special exhibit on art of the Himalayas before having to go. Back outside, we walked over to the Buckingham Memorial Fountain and watched its hourly show as the sun set. We got food from the nearby Buckingham Cafe and Grill after the show and ate while going to the car, walking through a crowd attending an outdoor film festival of some sort.</p>

<p>For our place to stay, we went to Arlington House International Hostel, where we had a private room reserved. My brother had a tough time finding parking, so we unloaded our bags then went to Lincoln Park, where the guy at the hostel counter said we could find free parking overnight. We found our room to be quite hot, even with the window open. After taking showers in the shared bathroom, we managed to sleep.</p>
