<p>We stopped at the gift shop in Whites City then entered Carlsbad Caverns National Park, immediately buying the entrance ticket and picking up my reserved tickets for the Lower Cave tour. I found out I had to buy gloves for protection of the cave formations, so I got some cheap but effective ones. I went back to my car to get stuff I needed to enter the cave, then realized I couldn't find my keys. It was frustrating not to find them anywhere. Then I stopped to think and realized they were still in my jacket, which I took off and put in the back seat. How silly I felt!</p>

<p>Soon we were on our way into Carlsbad Caverns, starting at the large natural entrance and descending. Already we were seeing interesting cave formations, but it didn't get really beautiful until we reached the Big Room. There, we walked around with me taking picture after picture of formations of many shapes and sizes. Sometimes, I used a tripod to show the lovely contrast of light and shadow that the park lighting enhanced. Most impressive were the big formations going by names such as &ldquo;Giant Dome,&rdquo; &ldquo;Temple of the Sun,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Rock of Ages.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After the delightful self-guided tour, Joy and I headed to the lunch room, 755 feet below the surface, to eat our sack lunches. We exited the cave by elevator, and with time left before our guided tour, Joy relaxed while I checked out the view from the observation area above the visitor center. I could see the Guadalupe Mountains to the south, in Texas.</p>

<p>We got our gloves and met with the ranger and other people going on the Lower Cave Tour. First, we were given information about our tour, safety tips, and our helmets with lights attached, then took the elevator down. Partway into the Big Room, we stopped and the ranger showed us where we were descending by rope. It was pretty easy making our way down the slope one by one. We then descended three sets of ladders to end up in Lower Cave.</p>

<p>Red plastic flagging tape defined the trail where we should step, but otherwise this part of the cave seemed mostly pristine and wild. At points we could look way up to where most tourists only go on the main path. I wondered if anyone could see us down here in the dark, noticing our helmet lights.</p>

<p>Other points of interest on this tour included pretty cave pearls, an old wooden ladder historically used by National Geographic to explore this part of the cave, graffiti from 1906, and a bat that got lost and died a long time ago now enclosed in transparent calcite. Our group made our way into one small room where we turned off all our lights to feel the peacefulness of the dark cave. We turned our lights back on, signed a registry, and went on our way back. People had the option to crouch through a low side passage at one point and Joy and I went for it.</p>

<p>After leaving the cave and returning the helmet, we took my car on the unpaved Walnut Canyon Desert Drive to see the Chihuahuan Desert above the caverns. The sun set as we finally made our way to Texas to camp in Guadalupe Mountains National Park. Spaces were filling fast in the Pine Springs Campground, but we made it there just in time. After eating and talking for a while, we slept.</p>
