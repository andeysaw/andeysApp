<p>After breakfast at the hotel, we checked out and headed by bus to Tian'anmen Square. My first view getting off the bus was that of the Great Hall of the People with the national emblem on top. We then entered the giant city square, which I heard could hold a million people. On one end was the tomb of Chairman Mao Zedong and a long line of people waiting to get a glimpse of the preserved body. The end we were going was Tian'anmen Gate, which had a large portrait of Chairman Mao on it.</p>

<p>Walking through the gate and then other gates, we then entered the Forbidden City, now a museum. Inside, there were more gates as well as important buildings with imperial furniture inside that people crowded together to see. The tour guide mentioned that the number of animal figurines on the roof of buildings determined its importance as she pointed to a building with nine figurines. Near the exit, I bought some postcards after bargaining down the price. Past the gate, there appeared to be a rock garden, with a couple interesting buildings built high atop sculpted masses of rock.</p>

<p>For our final shopping stop of the tour, we visited a Pearl Factory. Upon entering the place, employees showed an oyster from a tank and had people guess the number of pearls inside. No one got the number, which they revealed to be twenty, but some got low grade pearls as gifts. We all then entered the shop and I merely wandered around. Some people bought stuff.</p>

<p>We had our final lunch, then the bus took us to the Summer Palace, a royal complex north of the city. It was a beautifully decorated set of buildings and gardens, set next to bucolic Lake Kunming. I loved the artistry on the painted corridor near the shore, which the guide noted as the longest painted corridor in the world. It was indeed long as my brother and I walked its length, enjoying the surrounding scenery.</p>

<p>Past the end of the corridor, we came upon the Marble Boat, a magnificent stationary boat where Empress Dowager once had tea. It was built from funds that were supposed to strengthen the navy. We had just enough time after this to quickly walk back along the corridor to meet our tour guide as planned. The group then continued past some historic imperial residences before we exited the palace grounds.</p>

<p>I dropped off my final set of postcards at a green postbox, then got on the bus. We drove to a restaurant for an early dinner, then made it to the airport early for our night flight to Bangkok. We hung out at the gate for a while because the flight was slightly delayed. Once on the flight, I spent much of my time sleeping, waking up to eat the one meal served.</p>
