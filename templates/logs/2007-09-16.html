<p>I got up before Pat and got ready quickly. I walked from his place to Pier 42, stopping at a food cart along the way for a bagel with cream cheese. At the pier, I picked up a ticket at Circle Line for the three hour tour circumnavigating Manhattan Island. The line for entering the boat grew quickly and a vendor showed up selling overpriced beverages. My early arrival got me a pretty good seat port side on the upper deck and we all got to enjoy a sunny day.</p>

<p>Eventually, the boat departed and started south. The golf driving range at Chelsea Piers stood out for being an unusual waterfront feature. I also enjoyed the changing angles in viewing the tall skyline. The boat began approaching The Statue of Liberty, meanwhile giving us good looks at Newark and Ellis Island. A blimp passed over Liberty just as the boat slowed for photographs. We then headed back towards Manhattan Island, watching as the Lower Manhattan's tight cluster of skyscrapers grew closer.</p>

<p>As we rounded the tip of Lower Manhattan we began going under a series of bridges, starting with the famous Brooklyn Bridge then the Manhattan Bridge almost immediately after. We then passed Midtown where we spotted the Chrysler and Empire State Buildngs. The United Nations complex stood right along the waterfront. At the Queensboro Bridge, I saw the Roosevelt Island Tram pass above. More trees instead of buildings showed up after passing Yankee Stadium.</p>

<p>We continued under plenty more bridges in Northern Manhattan until finally reaching the Henry Hudson Bridge on the northern tip of the island, where we turned left onto the Hudson River. I spotted The Cloisters near there. After we went under the George Washington Bridge, I saw Grant's Tomb and Riverside Church. We then arrived back at Pier 42, where I saw much longer lines for the boat tour than in the morning.</p>

<p>I walked south along the piers and then west and passed the B&amp;H Superstore and Madison Square Garden. I then got on the subway to Brooklyn, where I walked to Grimaldi's Pizzeria under the Brooklyn Bridge. I waited in an outdoor line for quite a while before getting a seat in the packed indoors. Service was slow due to the overwhelming crowd, but otherwise I enjoyed a delicious small pepperoni, red peppers, and mushroom pizza. I bagged the leftovers.</p>

<p>From the pizzeria, I eventually found the pedestrian entrance to the Brooklyn Bridge, then started the scenic walk across. The platform rose in the middle between the opposing lanes of traffic. I looked all around at the views of Manhattan and Brooklyn and cautiously crossed the busy bicycle lanes when I checked out interpretive displays at each tower. At the other side, I exited near City Hall Park and then walked to St. Paul's Chapel to see it from the outside.</p>

<p>I continued west until I found myself at the World Trade Center site, where I looked at the construction and plans posted on the fence. I briefly looked inside the WTC PATH Station then headed back east, passing a table hawking purses. I eventually made my way to the South Street Seaport, where I took in the view of the East River and the Brooklyn Bridge. I also saw a memorial to the ocean liner Titanic at the seaport entrance.</p>

<p>Around sunset, I returned to the subway and made it to Times Square to look at its overload of flashy advertising. Even the subway and police station lighted up. I entered the huge Toys 'R Us store to look at its interior ferris wheel and large toy displays, declining to buy the photo taken of me at the entrance. After some more dazzlement at the bright lights, I returned to my friend Pat's place. He finally had an extra key to his place to give me.</p>

<p>Pat then took me to dinner at nearby Wondee 2 Thai Restaurant. He ran into some of his Thai friends there. I did not enjoy my order that much. When done, Pat gave me a walking tour of Midtown, starting with Columbus Circle with its fountain. We next visited the Rockefeller Center, walked past the Apple Store, then down 5th Avenue. We ended up at Times Square, where he showed me the Lehman Brothers display. We then returned to his place and I slept.</p>
