<p>We awoke early again and broke camp. On our way out of the canyon, we stopped at viewpoints we skipped the day before. They looked better in the morning light. One particular point gave us a view of a split, with Lamoille Canyon on one side and Right Fork Canyon on the other. We then took pictures by an official sign and looked for anything of interest at the Powerhouse Picnic Area, but found just picnic tables by a creek.</p>

<p>When we arrived in Elko, I stopped by the Forest Service office to see if I could get some information pamphlets only to find it closed, so we hit the road. A bit of scattered showers fell as we made our way west on Interstate 80. At Battle Mountain, we got fuel at a store on an Indian Reservation, noticing plenty of fireworks on the shelves. We arrived in Sparks just in time for lunch, stopping at the Nugget Casino.</p>

<p>After navigating the maze of gaming machines and asking directions, we found Rosie's Cafe and ordered two of the large Awful-Awful Burgers each split into two. This amount fed us without getting us too sleepy. We got the gas tank topped before entering more expensive California. As expected, we dealt with slow traffic after the Lake Tahoe area, in Davis and in Fairfield. Finally, we arrived in Berkeley around 7 PM, where we went our separate ways.</p>
