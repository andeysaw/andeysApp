<p>After some decent sleep, we got up and ate leftovers from dinner the night before. I got some utensils for us from a nearby gas station. We soon checked out of the place and made our way to the Alphabet District of Portland. My sister planned to meet a friend of hers at Papa Haydn. The rest of us looked around the area and ended up eating at Pepino's Mexican Grill, except for Liam, who had pizza.</p>

<p>When we met up with my sister, we looked around a little more then left Portland, going north. Soon, we entered the state of Washington. In Kelso, we stopped to get some food at a grocery store. We reached Seattle in the late afternoon and stopped at Pike Place Market, parking just below it. We wandered around the levels at the various types of shops, then left after a little more than an hour. Some shops began to close anyway at that time.</p>

<p>As we continued north, heavy traffic thinned considerably and trees dominated the landscape. We exited the interstate in Bellingham and found ourselves on a winding mountain road on our way to our timeshare at Snowater Resort in Glacier. It became really dark and began raining fairly heavily. We checked in at the security gate then found the condo, which I found cozy looking. We tried to get our luggage in without getting too wet.</p>

<p>To get to the condo before the office closed, we had to wait to eat dinner. Looking at the area around Glacier, we realized nothing in this rural area would have something open so late. We ended up going quite a bit down the mountain highway to Nooksack River Casino in Deming. While waiting for the food we ordered, my sister and Billy did some gambling. We returned to the condo after eating and slept.</p>
