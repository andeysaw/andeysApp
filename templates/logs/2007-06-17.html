<p>Soon after we got up, we did our final bit of packing, making sure we left nothing of ours around, then had our final complimentary breakfast. We formally checked out of the hotel then took the Connexxion Hotel Shuttle to Schiphol Airport. We checked in with Continental Airlines then ate a quick lunch from one of the small food vendors. We had a little bit of free time, so my brother and I quickly walked over to the Rijksmuseum Amsterdam Schiphol.</p>

<p>We found the little museum extension in the central part of the concourse. An escalator took us from the shop section up to the small gallery featuring a few example paintings of Dutch Realism behind glass walls. A few items used in one painting sat in a pedestal display. Not wanting to take any more chances with our time, we then hurried back to our parents to enter our terminal. Security briefly questioned and thoroughly checked everyone at the gate.</p>

<p>Our flight departed on time on its way to Newark, New Jersey. I spent my time on the flight checking out the entertainment and ended up watching the drama movie <em>Breach</em> and the silly movie <em>Wild Hogs.</em> We arrived in Newark on time and breezed through immigration and customs. We ate dinner at the airport, then boarded separate flights. I flew to San Francisco, watching part of the movie <em>Astronaut Farrner</em> before sleeping. I caught the BART train home.</p>
