<p>I left home uncertain that I had brought enough luggage, because I managed to pack everything into two carry-on bags. I would check in the larger one though, because it had more than 3 ounces of liquid somewhere inside, plus I didn't want to carry the weight around much. On the train to the airport in San Francisco, I thought I might have forgotten my security belt, but found it still on me, quite comfortably under my clothes.</p>

<p>I arrived with plenty of time to spare, not wishing to repeat barely making the gate like I did two weeks prior. Without any problems, I checked in one bag and breezed through security. I felt a bit hungry looking at the food stand by the gate, but decided to wait for the flight food. I had heard that Continental Airlines charged extra for pillows and earphones, so I brought my own, but it turns out I didn't need them. I still used my inflatable neck pillow, but used their earphones to browse through the mediocre music selection.</p>

<p>I arrived on time at the Bush Intercontinental Airport in Houston and, with a quick orientation from an employee, made my way towards the gate for my next flight. At one point, I stopped to look up at a ring of video screens flashing synchronized patterns. Continuing, I then heard my name and found my parents sitting at the food court of Terminal E. I got myself some food from Pappa's BBQ and shared the fries with my brother, who ate them heartily.</p>

<p>We had heard about delays due to thunderstorms at the Dallas-Ft. Worth airport and saw some ominous clouds, but fortunately our plane arrived on time and we departed as scheduled. When we reached cruise altitude, the attendants served us food and drink. I wasn't feeling very hungry, but ate anyway, then watched the movie <em>Freedom Writers,</em> which seemed the most interesting of the choices. Not a bad choice. Meanwhile my family tried to get some sleep.</p>
