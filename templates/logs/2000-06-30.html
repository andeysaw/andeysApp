<p>Camping in John Pennekamp Coral Reef State Park meant we had a discount on the first snorkeling trip, so we woke up and made our way to the office to sign up. Along with the tour, we rented the mask and fins. The snorkel itself was a complimentary souvenir.</p>

<p>After waiting a little, our group got onto the boat, where the instructor gave us some basic tips on safety and using the equipment. Once we were about five miles from shore in the Atlantic Ocean, we put on our gear, and got ready to dive in. My brother went first, so that I could take a couple pictures.</p>

<p>The water was wonderfully warm, so we had no problems entering. However, I had not snorkeled in a while and had to get used to the sensation. After some disorientation, minor panic, and gulps of disgusting sea water, I managed to swim away from the boat towards the coral reefs. The reefs came close to the surface, so I had to make sure I stayed afloat and only at the edges. I was certainly happy I had planned time for this experience.</p>

<p>Back on the boat, we drank up on fresh, cold water and relaxed as we got back to shore. At the visitor center, we returned our gear then got relief from the heat, looking at the aquariums that showed local sea life. We had to go back outside to the entrance kiosk to see if we could stay another night, but found out all the campsites had already been reserved for the holiday weekend.</p>

<p>We returned to our campsite to pack up, but then I discovered one of the tent stakes stayed stubbornly in the ground. Like the previous mornings, I first tried to lift the stake with the hook on the other end of our rubber mallet, but it straightened out, then broke off as I tried to bend it. I realized we needed some sort of lever to lift the stake &mdash; one narrow enough to get under the stake head and strong enough not to break.</p>

<p>It came to my mind that the tools used to change tires might work, so we emptied the trunk of our rental car and uncovered the spare tire with the jack underneath, but the jack could not fit under the stake head. Then I realized there should be a tool for turning the hex nuts and soon found that in the trunk. It fit, but did not give enough leverage. My brother then ingeniously suggested making the round head of the rubber mallet the fulcrum for the tool. After an attempt that broke some of the head, we were successful in lifting the stake.</p>

<p>On our way finally, we took the Overseas Highway southwest, heading for Key West. From the highway, Key Largo just seemed to be a typical commercial district, then the scenery got better as we crossed the bridges between the islands. Along the way, a sign warned how few key deer were left, so we looked out for any crossings of the small creature, never seeing any. I took the road all the way until it ended at Ft. Zachary Taylor State Historic site, where we turned around to park.</p>

<p>Walking around the town a little, I found a shop to buy postcards to send, then got back to the car. Going south, I noted that I passed the house of Ernest Hemingway. We stopped at a big marker that read &ldquo;90 miles to Cuba &mdash; Southernmost Point &mdash; Continental U.S.A.&rdquo; It appeared to be constantly photographed by different tourists. Once we got the chance, I used my tripod to take a photo of me and my brother by the marker.</p>

<p>We had a long way to go back, so we soon left, driving the entire 120 mile length of the Overseas Highway before reaching the Miami area. It was night time when I got there, and with the help of maps, we reached Miami Beach, where a sign welcomed us to the Art Deco District. We didn't really have time for more than quick look so we soon continued on our way north.</p>

<p>We reached Easterlin Park in Fort Lauderdale to camp. I didn't think a park within the limits of a city would be any good, but I was pleasantly surprised. We had called ahead, so the ranger was still there, expecting us. She forgave me for unwittingly parking on her porch, then showed us to the campsite that was in the best condition. However, it had one caveat &mdash; train tracks ran nearby, hidden by trees. I was too tired to care about that and managed to sleep well, being only slightly perturbed by passing trains.</p>
